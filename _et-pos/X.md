Definition


The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.<br/>
In Estonian UD v 1.3 foreign words are tagged as <code>X</code>. However, „fresh” loanwords that are part of an Estonian sentence, are not <code>X</code> but are tagged according to their word class.<br/>

Examples<br/>
In the following sentence, the wordforms <i>you, know, what, I, mean</i> are tagged as <code>X</code>:<br/>
<i>Viimane pole küll mingi eriline näitaja, kuid ... you know what I mean.</i>
