Definition

A verb typically signals events and actions; it can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause.
Verbs in Estonian associate with grammatical categories like person, number, tense, mood and voice.<br/>
The verb tag in Estonian UD v 1.3 does not cover auxiliaries <code>AUX</code>.<br/>
Auxiliaries are:<br/>
<i>olema</i> "be" and in rare occasions <i>saama</i> "get" are auxiliaries that form periphrastic tense forms;<br/>
modal verbs are <i>võima, tohtima</i> "may", <i>saama</i> "can", <i>pidama</i> "must", <i>näima, paistma, tunduma</i> "seem";<br/>
<i>ei</i> and <i>ära</i> "not" in negative verb forms.<br/>

Participles are word forms that share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on their syntactic function they are tagged as <code>VERB</code> or <code>ADJ</code> in Estonian UD.<br/>

Gerunds and infinitives are tagged as <code>VERB</code>, except for grammatized word-forms.
