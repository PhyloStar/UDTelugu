Pronominal adverbs, e.g. <i>siin</i> 'here', <i>seal</i> 'there', <i>siis</i> 'then', <i>millal</i> 'when' , <i>nii</i> 'so' are tagged as adverbs in the current version of Estonian UD.<br/>
Some adverbs may also function as verbal particles in Estonian, they are still tagged ADV and not PART, e.g. <i>välja mõtlema</i> 'contrive', lit. 'think out'.
