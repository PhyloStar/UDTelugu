### Description
<
Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or
phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal
parts of speech (e.g. adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating
conjunctions or auxiliary verbs).  Particles should be used scarcely in uralic
dependencies. What is called particle in lot of Uralic literature is typically
adverb `ADV`, interjection `INTJ` or adposition `ADP` in universal dependencies,
also `CCONJ` and `SCONJ` in limited amounts.

Enclitic discourse particles are not analysed in the current versions of Uralic
dependency schemes.

#### Examples

None in Finnish.
