#####Definition
A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.
Note that the VERB tag covers main verbs (content verbs) and copulas but it does not cover auxiliary verbs, for which there is the [AUX]() tag.

In Norwegian, modal verbs occurring alone, as in _<b>skal</b> hjem_ lit. _shall home_ "will go home" are tagged as `VERB`, but otherwise they will be `AUX`. Participles are annotated as verbs when they occur with auxiliaries *ha* "have", *få* "get" or a modal auxiliary. When the participle occurs with the copula or *bli* "become" or follows a head noun, the participle may be either adjective or verb (for syntactic tests to determine these cases, see Kinn et. al.).


#####Examples
* *løpe* "run", *løper* "runs", *løp* "ran", *(har) løpt* "(has) run"
* *spise* "eat", *spiser* "eats", *spiste* "ate", *(har) spist* "(has) eaten"
