####Definition
Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context.
In Norwegian, most determiners agree with the nominal head in terms of gender and number, e.g. _<b>min</b> bil_ "my car", _<b>mitt</b> barn_ "my child", _<b>mine</b> barn_ "my children". 
We distinguish three main types of determiners: possessive, demonstrative and quantifying.

**Possessive**

Possessive determiners agree in gender and number with the noun the modify, their form varies depending on person. In Norwegian, possessive determiners usually precede their head noun, but may occur after the head noun when the noun is in the definite form, e.g. _bilen <b>hans</b>_ "his car"
* _<b>mitt</b> barn_ "my child" 
* _<b>våre</b> barn_ "our children"
* _barnet <b>vårt</b>_ "our child"

**Demonstrative**

Demonstrative determiners agree in gender and number with the noun the modify. This group of determiners include the interrogative *hvilken* "which". The demonstratives may only precede the noun they modify.

* _<b>dette</b> barnet_ "this child", _<b>det</b> barnet_ "that child", _<b>den</b> bilen_"that car"
* _(det) <b>samme</b> barnet_ "(the) same child", _(det) <b>andre</b> barnet_ "(the) other child"
* _<b>hvilken</b> bil_ "which car", _<b>hvilket</b> hus_ "which house"  

**Quantifying**

The quantifying pronouns are a heterogenous group of determiners which all occur before the noun they modify. Some of these agree with their nominal head (like articles and indefinite determiners) and some do not.

* _<b>en</b> bil_ "a car", _<b>et</b> barn_ "a child", _<b>ei</b> jente_ "a girl"
* _<b>noen</b> biler_ "some cars"
* _<b>alle</b> biler_ "all cars"
* _<b>begge</b> bilene_ "both cars"
