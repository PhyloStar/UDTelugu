#####Definition
An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

Auxiliaries in Norwegian include  temporal, passive and modal auxiliaries (see below). Note that some modals can occur without a main verb (*skal hjem* lit. *shall home* "will go home") and will then be annotated as `VERB`.

#####Examples
* temporal: *ha* "have" (_<b>har</b> spist_ "has eaten"), *være* "be" (_<b>er</b> kommet_ "has come")
* passive: *bli* "become" (_<b>blir</b> spist_ "is eaten")
* modal: *kunne* "can", *skulle* "should", *ville* "will", *måtte* "must", *burde* "should" (_<b>kan/skal/vil/må/bør</b> spise_ "can/should/will/must/should eat")
