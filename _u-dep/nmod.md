The `nmod` relation is used for nominal dependents of another noun or noun phrase and functionally corresponds to
an attribute, or genitive complement.

**New from v2:** The `nmod` relation was previously used also for nominal dependents of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The latter are now covered by the new [obl]() relation.

In conjunction with the [case]() relation, `nmod` provides a uniform analysis for the possessive alternation:

~~~ sdparse
the Chair 's office
det(Chair-2, the-1)
nmod(office-4, Chair-2)
case(Chair-2, 's-3)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
the office of the Chair
det(office-2, the-1)
nmod(office-2, Chair-5)
case(Chair-5, of-3)
det(Chair-5, the-4)
~~~
