An `aux` (auxiliary) of a clause is a function word associated with a verbal predicate that
expresses categories such as tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality. It is often a verb 
(which may have non-auxiliary uses as well) but many languages have nonverbal TAME markers and these
are also treated as instances of `aux`. 

**New from v2:** Auxiliares used to construct the passive [voice](u-feat/Voice) are now also labeled `aux`,
although we strongly encourage the use of the subtype `aux:pass` in language that have a grammaticalized (periphrastic)
passive.
