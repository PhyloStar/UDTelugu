The 'orphan' relation is used in cases of head [ellipsis](http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/specific-syntax.html#ellipsis) where simple promotion would result in unnatural 
and misleading dependency relation. The typical case is predicate ellipsis where one of the core arguments
have to be promoted to clausal head.

~~~sdparse
Marie won gold and Peter bronze
nsubj(won, Marie)
obj(won, gold)
conj(won, Peter)
cc(Peter, and)
orphan(Peter, bronze)
~~~

In this example, the subject _Peter_ is promoted to the head position in the second conjunct. Attaching
the object _bronze_ to the subject is necessary to preserve the integrity of the clause, but using the
standard relation [obj]() would be misleading because _bronze_ is not the object of _Peter_. Therefore,
the `orphan` relation is used to indicate that this is a non-standard attachment. By contrast, the coordinating
conjunction _and_ performs essentially the same function as in the non-elliptical case and therefore retains
its normal relation `cc`.
