# Other Constructions

This section contains detailed discussion of particular linguistic constructions that fall outside (or cut across) the main categories of simple clause, complex clauses, and nominal phrases.

* [Coordination](#coordination)
* [Ellipsis](#ellipsis)
* [Multiword expressions](#multiword-expressions)
* [Comparative constructions](#comparatives)
* [Paratactic constructions](#paratactic-constructions)
* [Punctuation](#punctuation)


## Coordination

As discussed in the section on [complex clauses](complex-syntax.html), we treat coordinate structures asymmetrically
by attaching all non-first conjuncts to the first conjunct via the [u-dep/conj]() relation. Coordinating conjunctions and punctuation delimiting the conjuncts are attached to the immediately following conjunct using the [u-dep/cc]() and [u-dep/punct]() relations respectively. This analysis is applied to all cases of coordination at the clause, phrase or word level.

~~~ sdparse
He came home , took a shower and immediately went to bed .
conj(came, took)
conj(came, went)
punct(took, ,-4)
cc(went, and)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
He read the newspaper and a good book .
conj(newspaper, book)
cc(book, and)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
He read one or two books .
conj(one, two)
cc(two, or)
~~~

<a name="ellipsis"></a>

## Ellipsis

The UD approach to ellipsis can be summarized as follows:

1. If the elided element has no overt dependents, we do nothing.
2. If the elided element has overt dependents, we promote one of these to take the role of the head.
3. If the elided element is a predicate and the promoted element a core argument, we use the `orphan` relation when attaching other non-functional dependents to the promoted head.

### Ellipsis in Nominals

If the head nominal is elided, we promote dependents in the following order: `amod` > `nummod` > `det` > `nmod` > `case`.

Examples:

~~~ sdparse
Er kauft sich ein grünes Auto und sie kauft sich ein rotes . \n He buys himself a green car and she buys herself a red .

nsubj(kauft-2, Er-1)
det(Auto-6, ein-4)
amod(Auto-6, grünes-5)
obj(kauft-2, Auto-6)
conj(kauft-2, kauft-9)
nsubj(kauft-9, sie-8)
obj(kauft-9, rotes-12)
det(rotes-12, ein-11)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
She saw every animal at the zoo but he saw only some .

nsubj(saw-2, She-1)
det(animal-4, every-3)
obj(saw-2, animal-4)
conj(saw-2, saw-10)
advmod(some-12, only-11)
obj(saw-10, some-12)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
She saw three monkeys and he saw two .

nsubj(saw-2, She-1)
nummod(monkeys-4, three-3)
obj(saw-2, monkeys-4)
conj(saw-2, saw-7)
obj(saw-7, two-8)
~~~

### Ellipsis in Clauses

If the main predicate is elided, we use simple promotion only if there is an `aux` or `cop`, or a `mark` in the case of an infinitival marker.

Example:

~~~ sdparse
Sue likes pasta and Peter does , too .

nsubj(likes-2, Sue-1)
obj(likes-2, pasta-3)
conj(likes-2, does-6)
nsubj(does-6, Peter-5)
advmod(does-6, too-8)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Sue is hungry and Peter is , too .

nsubj(hungry-3, Sue-1)
cop(hungry-3, is-2)
conj(hungry-3, is-6)
nsubj(is-6, Peter-5)
advmod(is-6, too-8)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
They will do it if they want to .

nsubj(do-3, They-1)
aux(do-3, will-2)
obj(do-3, it-4)
advcl(do-3, want-7)
nsubj(want-7, they-6)
xcomp(want-7, to-8)
~~~

In more complicated cases where a predicate is elided but no `aux` or `cop` is present, simple promotion (without `orphan` deprels) could lead to very unnatural and confusing relations. For example, in the following sentence, _you_ would be the subject of _coffee_, suggesting that the second clause contains a copular construction rather than an elided predicate.

<div class="conllu-parse" tabs="yes">
# visual-style 6 5 nsubj color:red
1 I      I      _ PRP _ 2 nsubj _ _
2 like   like   _ VBP _ 0 root  _ _
3 tee    tee    _ NN  _ 2 obj   _ _
4 and    and    _ CC  _ 6 cc    _ _
5 you    you    _ PRP _ 6 nsubj _ _
6 coffee coffee _ VBP _ 2 conj  _ SpaceAfter=No
7 .      .      _ .   _ 2 punct _ _
</div>

In such cases, we promote dependents in the following order: `nsubj` > `obj` > `iobj` > `obl` > `advmod` > `csubj` > `xcomp` > `ccomp` > `advcl`
and for the non-promoted dependents, we use the special relation `orphan` to signal a non-standard dependency.
If it is necessary to select among several orphans of the same type (e.g. there are just two orphans and both are `advmod`),
the orphan occurring first (closer to the sentence start) is promoted.

~~~ sdparse
I like tea and you coffee .

nsubj(like-2, I-1)
obj(like-2, tea-3)
conj(like-2, you-5)
cc(you-5, and-4)
orphan(you-5, coffee-6)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Mary wants to buy a book and Jenny a CD .

nsubj(wants-2, Mary-1)
xcomp(wants-2, buy-4)
obj(buy-4, book-6)
conj(wants-2, Jenny-8)
orphan(Jenny-8, CD-10)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
They had left the company , many for good .

nsubj(left, They)
obj(left, company)
conj(left, many)
orphan(many, good)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Mary wants to buy a book . ROOT And Jenny a CD .

nsubj(wants-2, Mary-1)
xcomp(wants-2, buy-4)
obj(buy-4, book-6)
root(ROOT, Jenny)
orphan(Jenny, CD)
~~~

Note that the `orphan` relation is only used when an ordinary relation would be misleading (for example, when attaching an object to a subject). In particular, the ordinary `cc` relation should be used for the coordinating conjunction, which attaches to the pseudo-constituent formed through the `orphan` dependency.

## Multiword Expressions

Multiword expressions (MWEs) are combinations of words that (in some respect and to different degrees) behave
as lexical units rather than compositional syntactic phrases. The UD taxonomy contains three special relations
for analyzing MWEs:

* [u-dep/fixed]() are used to analyze fixed grammaticized MWEs like _in spite of_ (see above)
* [u-dep/flat]() are used to analyze exocentric semi-fixed MWEs like _Barack Obama_
* [u-dep/compound]() are used to analyze (endocentric) compounds like _noun phrase_

Structures analyzed with [u-dep/fixed]() and [u-dep/flat]() are headless by definition and are consistently
annotated by attaching all non-first elements to the first and only allowing outgoing dependents from the first element.

<div id="s8a" class="sd-parse">
We had a nice time in spite of the rain .
case(rain,in)
fixed(in,spite)
fixed(in,of)
obl(had,rain)
</div>

<div id="s8b" class="sd-parse">
Martin Luther King had a dream .
nsubj(had,Martin)
flat(Martin,Luther)
flat(Martin,King)
</div>

By contrast, [compounds](compound) are annotated to show their modification structure, including a regular concept of head:

<div id="s9" class="sd-parse">
I bought a computer disk drive enclosure .
nsubj(bought, I)
det(enclosure, a)
compound(drive, computer)
compound(drive, disk)
compound(enclosure, drive)
obj(bought, enclosure)
</div>

## Comparatives

The syntax of comparative constructions poses various challenges for linguistic theory.  For English, many of these are discussed in Bresnan (1973) and Huddleston and Pullum (2002, chapter 13). We give a discussion of equality comparisons (_That car is as big as mine_) and inequality scalar comparisons (_Sue is taller than Jim_).

In constructions of the form _as X as Y_ or _the same X as Y_, X and
Y can be of a range of syntactic types, leading to surface forms such as those exemplified below:

* _Commitment is as important as a player’s talent._
* _Get the cash to him as soon as possible._
* _I put in as much flour as the recipe called for._

We note that the head of the whole construction appears to be the head of the X phrase. We can simply say:

*  _Commitment is important._
*  _Get the cash to him soon._
*  _I put in flour._

We then say that the first _as_ is an independent modifier in the comparative, modifying something in the X phrase, in part because the following _as Y_ is fairly optional:

* _Commitment is (just) as important._
* _?Get the cash to him (just) as soon._
* _I put in (just) as much flour._

However, this first _as_ may not modify the head of X, it may modify an existing modifier of the head of X. Its role is adverbial ([u-dep/advmod]()) consistent with other kinds of degree modification:

~~~ sdparse
Commitment is as important as a player ’s talent .
advmod(important, as-3)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
I put in as much flour as the recipe called for .
advmod(much, as-4)
amod(flour, much)
~~~

We then take the complement of the comparative as an oblique dependent of the first part. It is clear that the material in the complement _as Y_ can be clausal. It is also usually optional, as indicated above. For that reason, we usually make the complement an [u-dep/advcl](), with the second _as_ analyzed as a mark.  That gives us:

~~~ sdparse
I do n't hear from my brother as often as I previously heard from him .
nsubj(hear, I-1)
aux(hear, do)
advmod(hear, n't)
case(brother, from-5)
det(brother, my)
obl(hear, brother)
advmod(often, as-8)
advmod(hear, often)
mark(heard, as-10)
nsubj(heard, I-11)
advmod(heard, previously)
advcl(often, heard)
case(him, from-14)
obl(heard, him)
punct(hear, .)
~~~

We take the _as Y_ clause as a dependent of the content-word whose degree is being assessed (here _often_). We take its head to be the head of the clause, here _heard_.  An initially plausible alternative analysis would be to make the clausal dependent headed by _as_ a dependent of the comparative modifier _as_, _more_, or _less_, and indeed this is the analysis which Huddleston and Pullum (2002) argue for in English. However, there are several reasons to doubt this analysis.  One is the general principles of UD in favoring content words as heads. A second argument is motivated by a desire for crosslinguistic adequacy: in languages such as Finnish and Japanese, this functional element is not present.

~~~ sdparse
“Y” より “X” が 面白い 。 \n Y than X NOM interesting .
nsubj(面白い, “X”)
case(“X”, が)
case(“Y”, より)
obl(面白い, “Y”)
punct(面白い, 。)
~~~

Since the first _as_ is a functional element, the dependent can be understood to modify the whole phrase _as often_, and therefore is attached to the head of that phrase. Additionally, it might be noted that comparatives without a comparative word occur in certain varieties of English. For example in Indian English you find usages such as _So don't worry if you think that you have a girl-friend, who is intelligent than you._ One further argument from morphological comparatives is discussed below.

The same basic analysis is given for inequality scalar comparatives, with _more_ or _less_ or a comparative adjective and _than_, parallel to the two uses of _as_ above, except that _more_ can also directly modify a noun, and _more_ is then taken to have the [u-dep/amod]() relation to the noun.  In this case, we take the comparative complement as directly depending on _more_, roughly seeing it as elliptical for _more numerous_.  In general, the comparative complement always depends on an adjective or adverb, and is usually an [advcl]() except when it is directly analyzed as an [obl]() (as discussed at the end of this section).

~~~ sdparse
more problems than you thought of last week
amod(problems, more)
advcl(more, thought)
mark(thought, than)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
more important than you thought
advmod(important, more)
advcl(important, thought)
mark(thought, than)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
more rapidly than you thought
advmod(rapidly, more)
advcl(rapidly, thought)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
a more difficult problem than you thought
advmod(difficult, more)
amod(problem, difficult)
advcl(difficult, thought)
~~~

In addition to crosslinguistic adequacy, we can see here another possible advantage of not attaching the _than_ clause to _more_: This analysis then means that the dependency structure is more parallel between cases with a periphrastic comparative like _more intelligent_ and a morphological comparative like _taller_ (even though in bound morpheme cases, the _-er_ could be argued to be the comparative head).

~~~ sdparse
smarter than you thought
advcl(smarter, thought)
mark(thought, than)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
fiksumpi kuin luulit \n smarter than you_thought
advcl(fiksumpi, luulit)
mark(luulit, kuin)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
a smarter boy than you thought
amod(boy, smarter)
advcl(smarter, thought)
mark(thought, than)
~~~

If the head is elided, then the functional element can be promoted.

~~~ sdparse
Wheat raises blood sugar even more than sugar does .
advcl(more, does)
~~~

Very commonly the complement clause in a comparative undergoes various amounts of partial reduction or ellipsis, sometimes to a quite extreme extent:

~~~ sdparse
I put in as much flour as the recipe called for .
nsubj(put, I)
compound(put, in)
advmod(much, as-4)
amod(flour, much)
obj(put, flour)
mark(called, as-7)
det(recipe, the)
nsubj(called, recipe)
advcl(much, called)
obl(called, for)
punct(put, .)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
He plays better drunk than sober
nsubj(plays, He)
advmod(plays, better)
acl(He, drunk)
mark(sober, than)
advcl(better, sober)
~~~

In general, we treat whatever remnant that remains as still an [u-dep/advcl](), as above.

However, a limiting case of this is that only a nominal is present:

* _as important as a player 's talent_
* _more important than a player 's talent_

The analysis in this case is unclear: Should the comparative complement still be analyzed as an extremely reduced complement clause or analyzed as simply a nominal modifier? There are arguments for both positions. For English, there is a long discussion of the arguments in section 2.2 of chapter 13 of Huddleston and Pullum (2002). We err on the side of minimizing the postulation of unobserved structure and opt to treat these cases as just an oblique nominal complement:

~~~ sdparse
as important as a player 's talent
advmod(important, as-1)
case(talent, as-3)
obl(important, talent)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
more important than a player 's talent
advmod(important, more)
case(talent, than)
obl(important, talent)
~~~

### _More than_ as a multi-word expression

In certain contexts the comparative complement combines both the action or adjective that is being compared
and the quantity it is compared to:

* _more than 90 percent (= over 90 percent)_
* _more than likely_
* _Home prices have more than doubled in the past decade._

In these cases we consider _more than_ to be a fixed multi-word expression because the two words are inseparable.
One cannot say _*more percent than 90._

~~~ sdparse
That is more than likely .
nsubj(likely, That)
cop(likely, is)
advmod(likely, more)
fixed(more, than)
punct(likely, .-6)
~~~

If the expression modifies a counted noun phrase, it attaches directly to the modified number:

~~~ sdparse
more than two years ago
nummod(years, two)
fixed(more, than)
advmod(two, more)
~~~

If there is no number (because the indefinite article functions as the number “one”), it attaches directly to the head noun:

~~~ sdparse
more than a year ago
det(year, a)
fixed(more, than)
advmod(year, more)
~~~

## Paratactic Constructions

The [parataxis]() relation is used to analyze a number of constructions where clauses are combined
by relations that are looser than standard coordination.

### Side-by-side sentences ("run-on sentences")

The [parataxis]() relation is used for a pair of what could have been standalone sentences,
but which are being treated together as a single sentence. This may happen because sentence
segmentation of the sentence was done primarily following the presence of sentence-final punctuation,
and these clauses are joined by punctuation such as a colon or comma, or not delimited by punctuation
at all. In a spoken corpus, it may happen because what is labeled as a sentence is more
commonly an utterance turn. Even if the treebanker is doing the sentence division, it may
happen because there seems to be a clear discourse relation linking two clauses.
Sometimes there are more than two sentences joined in this way. In this case we make all the later sentences
dependents of the first one, to maximize similarity to the analysis used for conjunction.

~~~ sdparse
Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food to move .
parataxis(hunters, need)
~~~

This relation may happen with units that are smaller than sentences:

~~~ sdparse
Divided world the CIA
amod(world, Divided)
parataxis(world, CIA)
det(CIA, the)
~~~

### Reported Speech

For this reported speech example:

~~~ sdparse
The guy , John said , left early in the morning
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

there are paraphrases that convey essentially the same meaning but
with a different syntactic structure. When the reported speech is embedded in a subordinate clause (with or
without an overt complementizer _that_), the subordinate clause is a [ccomp]() of the speech verb. When the
reported speech follows the speech verb and is separated by a colon, the reported speech forms a main clause
that attaches to the preceding main clause with a [parataxis]() relation, hence with the speech verb as its head.
However, when the speech verb occurs as a medial or final parenthetical, the relation is reversed and the speech
verb is treated as a [parataxis]() of the reported speech.
This analysis is not uncontroversial but follows many authorities, such as Huddleston and Pullum (2002),
_The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language_ (see chapter 11, section 9).

~~~ sdparse
John said that the guy left early in the morning .
ccomp(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
John said the guy left early in the morning .
ccomp(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
John said : “ The guy left early in the morning . ”
parataxis(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
“ The guy left early in the morning ” , John said .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The guy left early in the morning , John said .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The guy , he said , left early in the morning .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

An argument for this analysis is that in the cases analyzed as embedding, the entire clause
can be further embedded (_I was taken aback when John said the guy left early in the morning._),
while this is not possible with medial or final placement of the speech verb
(_*I was taken aback when the guy left early this morning, John said._).

### News Article Bylines

We have used the parataxis relation to connect the parts of a news article byline.
There does not seem to be a better relation to use.

~~~ sdparse
Washington ( CNN ) :
parataxis(Washington, CNN)
~~~

### Interjected Clauses

Single word or phrase interjections are analyzed as [discourse](), but when a whole clause is interjected, we use the relation parataxis.

~~~ sdparse
Calafia has great fries ( they are to die for ! )
parataxis(has, are)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Just to let you all know Matt has confirmed the booking for 3rd Dec is OK .
parataxis(confirmed, let)
~~~

In the second example, we treat the second half as the head of the dependency
because the first half feels like a whole clause interjection, not like the main clause of the utterance.

### Tag Questions

We also use the parataxis relation for tag questions such as _isn't it?_ or _haven't you?_.

~~~ sdparse
It 's not me , is it ?
parataxis(me, is)
~~~
* Direct and reported speech: currently described under [u-dep/parataxis]()

### Feedback words

In a sentence starting with a feedback word such as _yes_ or _no_ and continuing with a main clause, we take the predicate of the main clause to be the root of the sentence and attach the feedback word to this predicate with a [discourse]() relation:

~~~ sdparse
yes , we should apply for membership .
discourse(apply, yes)
~~~

However, when the feedback is expressed by a full clause instead of a feedback word, the predicate of this clause is taken as the root and the predicate of the following clause is attached with a [parataxis]() relation:

~~~ sdparse
I agree , we should apply for membership .
parataxis(agree, apply)
~~~

## Punctuation

Tokens with the relation [u-dep/punct]() always attach to content words (except in cases of ellipsis) and can never have dependents. Since `punct` is not a normal dependency relation, the usual criteria for determining the head word do not apply.
Instead, we use the following principles:

1. A punctuation mark separating coordinated units is attached to the immediately following conjunct.
2. A punctuation mark preceding or following a subordinated unit is attached to this unit.
3. Within the relevant unit, a punctuation mark is attached at the highest possible node that preserves projectivity.
4. Paired punctuation marks (quotes and brackets) should be attached to the same word unless that would create non-projectivity. This word is usually the head of the phrase enclosed in the paired punctuation.

<div id="punct1" class="sd-parse">
We have apples , pears , oranges , and bananas .
obj(have, apples)
conj(apples, pears)
conj(apples, oranges)
conj(apples, bananas)
cc(bananas, and)
punct(pears, ,-4)
punct(oranges, ,-6)
punct(bananas, ,-8)
</div>

<div id="punct2" class="sd-parse">
Der Mann , den Sie gestern kennengelernt haben , kam wieder .
punct(kennengelernt, ,-3)
punct(kennengelernt, ,-9)
punct(kam, .)
</div>

<div id="punct3" class="sd-parse">

punct(AKA, ,-2)
punct(a/k/a, ,-4)
punct(refer, :)
