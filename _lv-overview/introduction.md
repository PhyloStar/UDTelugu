# Introduction

Latvian UD Treebank is based on the Latvian Treebank. Latvian Treebank was created 2010-2014 in the University of Latvia, Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science. Latvian Treebank is annotated according to an in-house hybrid annotation model and then automatically transformed to UD.

Annotations in Latvian Treebank:

* POS tag - semi-automatic;
* Lemmas - semi-automatic;
* Syntax - fully manual;

Annotations in Latvian UD Treebank:

1. ID: Word index, currently no ranges used.
2. FORM: Word form from Latvian Treebank - "words with spaces" are splitted automatically, otherwise used as-is.
3. LEMMA: Lemma from Latvian Treebank - for "words with spaces" are splitted automatically, otherwise used as-is.
4. UPOSTAG: Universal part-of-speech tag is automatically induced from original POS tag and syntactic role.
5. XPOSTAG: Original POS tag.
6. FEATS: List of morphological features is automatically induced from original POS tag and wordform.
7. HEAD: Head of the current token is automatically induced from original annotations.
8. DEPREL: Universal Stanford dependency relation to the HEAD is automatically induced from original annotation.
9. DEPS: Not used.
10. MISC: Curently only `SpaceAfter=No` and (since UDv2.0) `NewPar=Yes` are used.
