# Introduction

The Czech UD treebank is based on the [Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) (PDT),
created at the Charles University in Prague.
The treebank consists of 87,913 sentences (1.5 M tokens) and its domain is mainly newswire, reaching also to business and popular scientific articles from the 1990s.
The treebank is licensed under the terms of [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)
and its original (non-UD) version can be downloaded from
[http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-097C-0000-0023-1AAF-3](http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-097C-0000-0023-1AAF-3).

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Czech UD treebank is created through a conversion of PDT data.
The conversion procedure has been designed by Dan Zeman.

## Source of annotations

This table summarizes the origins and checking of the various columns of the CoNLL-U data.

| Column | Status |
| ------ | ------ |
| ID | Sentence segmentation and (surface) tokenization was automatically done and then hand-corrected; see [PDT documentation](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/doc/pdt-guide/en/html/ch02.html). Splitting of fused tokens into syntactic words was done automatically during PDT-to-UD conversion. |
| FORM | Identical to Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0 form. |
| LEMMA | Manual selection from possibilities provided by morphological analysis: two annotators and then an arbiter. PDT-to-UD conversion stripped from lemmas the ID numbers distinguishing homonyms, semantic tags and comments; this information is preserved as attributes in the MISC column. |
| UPOSTAG | Converted automatically from XPOSTAG (via [Interset](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/interset)), from the semantic tags in PDT lemma, and occasionally from other information available in the treebank; human checking of patterns revealed by automatic consistency tests. |
| XPOSTAG | Manual selection from possibilities provided by morphological analysis: two annotators and then an arbiter. |
| FEATS | Converted automatically from XPOSTAG (via Interset), from the semantic tags in PDT lemma, and occasionally from other information available in the treebank; human checking of patterns revealed by automatic consistency tests. |
| HEAD | Original PDT annotation is manual, done by two independent annotators and then an arbiter. Automatic conversion to UD; human checking of patterns revealed by automatic consistency tests. |
| DEPREL | Original PDT annotation is manual, done by two independent annotators and then an arbiter. Automatic conversion to UD; human checking of patterns revealed by automatic consistency tests. |
| DEPS | &mdash; (currently unused) |
| MISC | Information about token spacing taken from PDT annotation. Lemma / word sense IDs, semantic tags and comments on meaning moved here from the PDT lemma. |
