Similarly to [Gender](), animacy is
a lexical feature of [nouns](ru-pos/NOUN) and inflectional
feature of other parts of speech that mark agreement with nouns. It is
independent of gender, therefore it is encoded separately in some
tagsets (e.g. all the Multext-East tagsets). 

### `Anim`: animate

Human beings, animals, fictional characters, names of professions
etc. are all animate. Even nouns that are normally inanimate can be
inflected as animate if they are personified. For instance, consider a
children's story about cars where cars live and talk as people; then
the cars may become and be inflected as animates.

PDT examples of masculine animate nouns:

- _человек&nbsp;_ “man”, _министр&nbsp;_ “minister”, _президент&nbsp;_ “president”, _председатель&nbsp;_ “chairman”, _режиссёр&nbsp;_ “director”

### `Inan`: inanimate

Nouns that are not animate are inanimate.

RNC (Russian National Corpus) examples of masculine inanimate nouns:

- _род&nbsp;_ “year”, _закон&nbsp;_ “law”, _состояние&nbsp;_ “state”, _падеж&nbsp;_ “case”, _миллион&nbsp;_ “million”
