Case is an inflectional feature of [nouns](ru-pos/NOUN) and
other parts of speech ([adjectives](ru-pos/ADJ),
[numerals](ru-pos/NUM)) that mark agreement with nouns.
It is also valency feature of [prepositions](ru-pos/ADP) (saying that
the preposition requires its argument to be in that case).

Case helps to specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence.
For example, the nominative
and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,
while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be
distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

Czech morphology distinguishes seven cases:
`Nom`, `Gen`, `Dat`, `Acc`, `Loc` and `Ins`
(this ordering is fixed in the grammar and the cases are also referred to by numbers 1–7).

#### Examples

* singular nominative _мама&nbsp;_ “mother”, genitive _мамы&nbsp;,_ dative _маме,&nbsp;_
  accusative _маму,&nbsp;_ locative _маме,&nbsp;_ instrumental _мамой_
* plural nominative _мамы,&nbsp;_ genitive _мам,&nbsp;_ dative _мамам,&nbsp;_
  accusative _мам,&nbsp;_ locative _мамах,&nbsp;_ instrumental _мамами_

The descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic
hints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that
quite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally
unrelated to the meaning mentioned here. Valency of verbs,
adpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must
be in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot
(semantic role).

### `Nom`: nominative

The base form of the noun, also used as citation form (lemma).
This is the word form used for subjects of clauses.

### `Gen`: genitive

Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow
belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English
preposition _of._

Note that despite considerable semantic overlap, the genitive case is
not the same as the feature of possessivity ([Poss]()). Possessivity
is a lexical feature, i.e. it applies to lemma and its whole
paradigm. Genitive is a feature of just a subset of word forms of the
lemma. Semantics of possessivity is much more clearly defined while
the genitive (as many other cases) may be required in situations that
have nothing to do with possessing. For example, _без папиной дочери&nbsp;_ “without the father's daughter” is a
prepositional phrase containing the preposition _без&nbsp;_ “without”, the
possessive adjective _папиной&nbsp;_ “father's” and the noun _дочери&nbsp;_
“daughter”. The possessive adjective is derived from the noun
_папа&nbsp;_ but it is really an adjective (with separate lemma and
paradigm), not just a form of the noun. In addition, both the
adjective and the noun are in their genitive forms (the nominative
would be _папина дочь_).  There is nothing possessive about
this particular occurrence of the genitive. It is there because the
preposition _без&nbsp;_ always requires its argument to be in genitive.

#### Examples

* _Москва - столица <b>Российской Федерации</b>.&nbsp;_ “Moscow is the
  capital <b>of the Russian Federation</b>.”

### `Dat`: dative

This is the word form often used for indirect objects of verbs.

#### Examples

* _Я дал подарок <b>своему брату</b>.&nbsp;_ “I gave my brother a present.”
  (_своему брату&nbsp;_ “my brother” is dative and
  _подарок&nbsp;_ “present” is accusative.)

### `Acc`: accusative

Perhaps the second most widely spread morphological case.
This is the word form most frequently used for direct objects of verbs.

### `Loc`: locative

The locative case often expresses location in space or time, which
gave it its name. As elsewhere, non-locational meanings also exist and
they are not rare. On the other hand, some location roles
may be expressed using other cases (e.g. because those cases are
required by a preposition).

This is the only Russian case that is used exclusively in
combination with prepositions.

#### Examples

* _В <b>июле</b> я был в <b>Швеции</b>.&nbsp;_ “In <b>July</b>
  I was in <b>Sweden</b>.”
* _Разговаривали мы там о <b>морфологии</b>.&nbsp;_ “We talked there about
  <b>morphology</b>.” (Non-locational non-temporal example)

### `Ins`: instrumental

The role from which the name of the instrumental case is derived is
that the noun is used as instrument to do something (as in _писать
<b>ручкой</b>&nbsp;_ “to write <b>using a pen</b>”).  Many other meanings are
possible, for example the instrumental is required by the
preposition _s&nbsp;_ “with” and thus it includes the meaning expressed in
other languages by the comitative case.

In Russian the instrumental is also used for the agent-object in passive
constructions (cf. the English preposition _by_).

#### Examples

* _Этот закон был одобрен <b>правительством</b>.&nbsp;_ “This bill has been
  approved <b>by the government</b>.” (Passive example)
