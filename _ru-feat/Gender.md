Gender is a lexical feature of [nouns](ru-pos/NOUN) and inflectional feature
of other parts of speech ([adjectives](ru-pos/ADJ), [verbs](ru-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with
nouns. There are three values of gender: masculine, feminine, and neuter.

### `Masc`: masculine gender

Nouns denoting male persons are masculine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically masculine, without any relation to sex.

#### Examples

* _<b>мужчина</b>&nbsp;_ “man”
* _<b>замок</b>&nbsp;_ “castle”
* _<b>грузовик</b>&nbsp;_ “truck”
* _<b>председатель</b>&nbsp;_ “chairman”
* _<b>судья</b>&nbsp;_ “judge”

### `Fem`: feminine gender

Nouns denoting female persons are feminine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically feminine, without any relation to sex.

#### Examples

* _<b>женщина</b>&nbsp;_ “woman”
* _<b>роза</b>&nbsp;_ “rose”
* _<b>песня</b>&nbsp;_ “song”
* _<b>кость</b>&nbsp;_ “bone”

### `Neut`: neuter gender

This third gender is for nouns that are neither
masculine nor feminine (grammatically).
Nouns whose nominative suffix is _-о&nbsp;_ or _-е&nbsp;_
(including a large group of deverbative nouns denoting actions)
are usually neuter.

#### Examples

* _<b>место</b>&nbsp;_ “place”
* _<b>море</b>&nbsp;_ “sea”
* _<b>мясо</b>&nbsp;_ “meat”
* _<b>здание</b>&nbsp;_ “building”
