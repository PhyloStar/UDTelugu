Polarity in Russian is a feature of verbs, adjectives, adverbs and nouns used to express negation. Negation in Russian is done both by using the bound morpheme _не-_
and an independent negating particle (equivalent to English “not”). Words that can take the morpheme/particle of negation have
the feature of negativeness.

It applies to [verbs](ru-pos/VERB),
[adjectives](ru-pos/ADJ), sometimes also [adverbs](ru-pos/ADV) and
even [nouns](ru-pos/NOUN).
(Most nouns have just `Polarity=Pos`;
deverbative nouns can have also `Polarity=Neg`.)

Note that `Polaritye=Neg` is not the same thing as
[PronType]()`=Neg`. For pronouns and other pronominal parts of speech
there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and adjectives. (There
is no such thing as “affirmative pronoun”.)

### `Pos`: positive, affirmative

#### Examples

* _он <b>пришёл</b>&nbsp;_ “he came”
* _<b>разумный</b>&nbsp;_ “wise”
* _<b>хорошо</b>&nbsp;_ “nicely”
* _<b>приятие</b>&nbsp;_ “acceptance”

### Polarity: negative

#### Examples

* _он <b>не пришёл</b>&nbsp;_ “he did not come”
* _<b>неразумный</b>&nbsp;_ “unwise”
* _<b>нехорошо</b>&nbsp;_ “nastily”
* _<b>неприятие</b>&nbsp;_ “non-acceptance, rejection”
