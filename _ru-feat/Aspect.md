Aspect is a feature that specifies duration of the action in time,
whether the action has been completed etc.

In Russian, aspect is considered a lexical feature of [verbs](ru-pos/VERB).
While many imperfective verbs have morphologically related perfective counterparts,
it is not a regular system
and the two verbs are represented by different lemmas.

### `Imp`: imperfect aspect

The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.

#### Examples

* _печь&nbsp;_ “to bake” (Imp); _<b>пёк</b> хлеб&nbsp;_ “he baked / was
  baking a bread”

### `Perf`: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been completed. Since there is
emphasis on one point on the time scale (the point of completion),
this aspect does not work well with the present tense.
Russian morphology can create present forms of perfective verbs but
these actually have a future meaning.

#### Examples

* _испечь&nbsp;_ “to bake” (Perf); _<b>испёк</b> хлеб&nbsp;_ “he baked / has
  baked a bread”
