# Introduction

Ancient Greek is here defined as the Greek language from the first attested texts to 1453. There are two treebanks with Ancient Greek data.

## The Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank (UD\_Ancient\_Greek)

The Ancient Greek UD treebank is based on the
[Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2.0](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data) (AGDT),
currently maintained at Leipzig University (Humboldt Chair in DH, Prof. Gregory Crane).
The treebank consists of literary texts of different genres.

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Ancient Greek UD treebank is created through
a conversion of the [AGDT 2.0](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/tree/master/v2.0/nonArethusaCompliant) data. The conversion has been made by Giuseppe G. A. Celano.

## The PROIEL Treebank of Ancient Greek (UD\_Ancient\_Greek-PROIEL)

This UD treebank is a conversion of the PROIEL treebank of Ancient Greek, release [20170214](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/releases/tag/20170214), currently maintained at the University of Oslo. The treebank consists of the New Testament plus approximately half of Herodotus' Histories. The original annotation guidelines are available at [http://folk.uio.no/daghaug/syntactic_guidelines.pdf](http://folk.uio.no/daghaug/syntactic_guidelines.pdf)

The treebank was converted to UD by Dag Haug. The conversion code is released as part of the [PROIEL command-line interface](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-cli).
