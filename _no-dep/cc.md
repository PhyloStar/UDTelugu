For more on coordination, see the [conj]() relation. A cc is the relation between the first conjunct and the coordinating conjunction delimiting another conjunct.

Kamskjell , piggvar og lammefilet sto på menyen \n Scallops , turbot and lamb were on the menu

A coordinating conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a sentence. This is also called a cc, and it depends on the root predicate of the sentence.
