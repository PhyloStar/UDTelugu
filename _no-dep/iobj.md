The indirect object of a verb is any nominal phrase that is a core argument of the verb but is not its subject or direct object. The `iobj` relation presupposes a `obj` argument of the same word and is only used for nominal arguments. Note that nominals with a preposition such as *til* "to" which are semantically similar to indirect object in the expression of a recipient role are not analyzed as `iobj`.
