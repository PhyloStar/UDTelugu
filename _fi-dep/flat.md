Proper names constituted of more than one word are annotated using the dependency type `flat`. The first (leftmost) word is the head, and the other words are direct dependents of the head.

The `flat` dependency relation is used in cases where the multi-word name does not have an obvious internal syntactic structure, as is the case with for instance names of people (*Matti Virtanen*) or cities (*New York*).

If a name has an obvious internal structure, as is often the case in names of books and movies for instance, this structure is marked instead, and the `flat` relation is marked as a secondary relation (DEPS field) spanning over the whole name phrase (from first token to the last).
