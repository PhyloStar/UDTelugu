shortdef : 'remnant in ellipsis'

The `orphan` relation is used to provide a treatment of ellipsis (in
the case of gapping and stripping, where a predicational or verbal
head gets elided). In particular, `orphan` aims to provide analyses
that do not postulate empty nodes.

### Diffs

FinnTreeBank (FI_FTB) does not apply the relation `orphan`.
Instead, in elliptical cases the relation [`conj`]() has been
chosen to correspond to its correlate in a preceding clause.
