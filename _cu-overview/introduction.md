# Introduction

This UD treebank is a conversion of the PROIEL treebank of Old Church Slavonic, release [20170214](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/releases/tag/20170214), currently maintained at the University of Oslo. The treebank consists of the Codex Marianus, which contains a translation of parts of the New Testament Gospels. The original annotation guidelines are available at [http://folk.uio.no/daghaug/syntactic_guidelines.pdf](http://folk.uio.no/daghaug/syntactic_guidelines.pdf)

The treebank was converted to UD by Dag Haug. The conversion code is released as part of the [PROIEL command-line interface](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-cli).
