The `xcomp` relation is used for clausal complements of verbs which function like objects, but unlike [ccomp]() lack an explicit subject. The reference of the subject is determined by an argument external to the xcomp clause, which means that the clause inherits its subject from  higher up in the tree.

### Secondary predicates

The xcomp relation is also used in constructions that are known as _secondary predicates_.
In this type of construction there are two predicates mixed in one clause, and each of the predicates constitutes a core argument.

The 2 predicates in the following example are:

- something is given a name
- this name is "hemorrage"
