The `conj:appos` relation is used instead of `appos` for appositions which respect the prosody of lists. The elements in a `conj:appos` are not bound to a particular sequence, they can be rearranged in a different order. This choice of relation is meant to emphasize the similarity between some appositions and ordinary coordination.


Not all appositions respect these critierias, for appositions which modify nominal elements but without showing these similarities to coordinations we use the [nmod:appos]() relation instead.
