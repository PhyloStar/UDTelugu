# Introduction

These guidelines describe the application of the Stanford Universal Dependency scheme (de Marneffe et al. 2014) to Sahidic Coptic sentences. Where cases are left unspecified, the principles governing the Universal Dependency guidelines for languages other than Coptic may be consulted (see http://universaldependencies.org/). 

In general, the attempt has been made to remain ‘lexico-centric’ in preferring lexical items as the heads of sub-trees, i.e. Coptic prepositions are analyzed as ‘case markers’, and the lexical infinitive is seen as the verbal root, with conjugation bases forming auxiliaries. 

Some functions from the Universal Dependencies are not used, most notably labels for passives. Although Coptic has some form of passive constructions, they are not easily distinguishable and often ambiguous (actional passive identical with third person active sentence in the absence of a singular agent phrase; stative passive depending on transitivity of the verb for interpretation; see the nsubj label below). In these, and other cases, the realistic demands that accurate automatic parsing must satisfy have played a role in the decision in favor of a simpler analysis.

The dependency guidelines assume part of speech tagging based on the Coptic Scriptorium Guidelines (Zeldes & Schroeder 2016). Please consult the tagging guidelines for background on tagging, as well as tokenization decisions (e.g. portmanteau tokens and tags, such as fused ⲉⲣⲉ for 2nd person feminine singular, etc.; see Section 3). In general, these guidelines have been formed to complement the POS tag’s expressivity, e.g. favoring distinctions that cannot be easily obtained from the POS tags (for example the label `amod` for the archaic attributive adjectives, which have no distinct POS tag).
