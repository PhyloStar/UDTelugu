Used for all prepositions, including the marker of accusative case ⲛ and all other prepositions, which are understood as ‘oblique’ cases. Nouns govern their prepositions as in all other Universal Dependency guidelines, and not the other way around.

The hermeneutic particle ⲛϭⲓ, roughly ‘namely’, is also considered a case marker, assigning nominative case (it is only compatible with subject appositions, never objects or obliques, cf. Grossman 2014); see `dislocated` for more guidelines on ⲛϭⲓ.
