Used to mark direct forms of address, usually introduced by a definite article: ⲡⲉϣⲃⲣⲣϩⲱⲃ!  ‘oh you accomplice!’. If the vocative forms the entire utterance, it is labeled vocative and functions as the root of the utterance. If there is a further proposition in the sentence (usually an imperative), then the vocative is attached to the root of the predication:
