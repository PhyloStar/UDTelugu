This label is used for arguments or ‘hanging topics’ that are preposed before the verbal complex, and which are referred to again as pronouns governed by the verbal complex.

Note how the lexical arguments ‘the shame … the glory’ act as dislocated and are pre-posed, to be referred to again as pronouns by the pronoun object ‘them’, which acts as dobj (forsaken what? them. What is them? shame + glory). The dislocation is linked to the word governing the ‘duplicate pronoun’, usually the verb (here ⲡⲁⲣⲁⲓⲧⲉⲓ ‘forsake’, which also governs the object pronoun).
