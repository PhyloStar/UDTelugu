Head of an adjectival or relative clause, usually marking the verb or nominal predicate in that clause, when the clause is marked by a relative converter (the Coptic language specific POS tag `CREL`, which is given the label `mark`, regardless of which form is used, such as ⲉⲧ, ⲉⲧⲉ, ⲉⲧⲉⲣⲉ or ⲉ; for circumstantial conversion see `advcl`). The arrow points from the modified element (usually a noun) to the predicate of the relative clause.

Example:

~~~ sdparse
ⲛⲉⲧⲛ ⲏⲣⲡ ⲉⲧ ⲗⲟⲙⲥ \n your wine which is foul
acl(ⲏⲣⲡ, ⲗⲟⲙⲥ)
mark(ⲗⲟⲙⲥ,ⲉⲧ)
~~~
