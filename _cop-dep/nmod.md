A nominal modifier. This is the label given to prepositional objects and other types of nominal dependents which are non-core arguments (i.e. neither subject nor object). Note that in keeping with Universal Dependencies for other languages, the `nmod` noun attaches directly to the lexeme it modifies (usually a noun or verb), while the preposition is seen as a `case` dependent of the modifying noun.

Note also that prepositional arguments of verbs are also marked as `nmod`, including prepositional objects of verbs of perception:
