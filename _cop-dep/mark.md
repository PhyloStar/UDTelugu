Marker indicating clause status. For subordinate clauses, this is the subordinating conjunction or particle, such as ϫⲉ introducing the object clause of direct or indirect speech, a relative pronoun such as ⲉⲧ, or an adverbial subordination, such as the circumstantial converter ⲉ/ⲉⲣⲉ. In Coptic, some main clauses also have marker elements determining clause status, which are morphologically and paradigmatically comparable to subordinators: the focalizing and preterit converters. As a result, all converters (POS tags CCIRC, CREL, CPRET and CFOC) are treated as `mark`, modifying their clause’s predicate, but also non-converter conjunctions with similar functions (e.g. ⲉⲛⲉ ‘if’) as shown in the examples below.
