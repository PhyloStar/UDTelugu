This label marks the copula forms ⲡⲉ, ⲧⲉ, ⲛⲉ. Note that the copula is not the root of a copula predication, but rather a dependent of the lexical predicate, usually a noun preceding the copula, but sometimes a verb (especially with preterit conversion, followed by the ‘optional’ copula). Both cases are illustrated below.

Also note that in nominal sentences, the subject is `nsubj` to the predicate, not to the copula. This is also true when the subject follows the copula, as shown below.
