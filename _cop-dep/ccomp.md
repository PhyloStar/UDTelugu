Marks a complement clause, e.g. an object clause to a verb of saying (said that: …., saw that: …). The dependency goes from the main clause predicate to the subordinate clause predicate. Markers like ϫⲉ are governed by the `mark` function (see `mark`).

Note how the verb "know" (ⲥⲟⲟⲩⲛ) is the source of `ccomp`, and the subordinate clause main verb, "tear" (ⲡⲁϩ), is the target.
