A clausal subject is a clausal syntactic subject of a clause, i.e.,
the subject is itself a clause. The governor of this relation might
not always be a verb: when the verb is a copular verb, the root of the
clause is the complement of the copular verb. The dependent is the main lexical verb or other 
predicate of the subject clause.
