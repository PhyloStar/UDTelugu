NOTE: This relation is not in use in UD 2.0+. The universal relation *cc* is used instead since all cc's are now attached to the next conjunct to the right. 

A preconjunct is the relation between the head of an NP and a word
that appears at the beginning bracketing a conjunction (and puts
emphasis on it), such as *either*, *both*, *neither*, *and*, *but*).
