A copula is the relation between the nominal predicate and
the copular verb _<b>быть</b>_ “to be” (or its variants _бывал, был_).
The verb _становиться_ “to become”, despite being counted among copular verbs by some authors,
is not analyzed as `cop`.

We normally take a copula as a dependent of its complement (the nominal predicate).
The nominal predicate is usually a [noun](cs-pos/NOUN), an [adjective](cs-pos/ADJ)
or a <a href="../feat/VerbForm.html#part-participle">participle</a>.
