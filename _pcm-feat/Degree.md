In Naija,  `Degree` is a feature of [adjectives](pcm-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](pcm-pos/ADV).

Note: The 1st degree marked in English morphology `Pos` is left without feature in our dictionary.

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative

An object is compared to another on the basis of an attribute.

#### Example

* _bigger_

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative

An object is compared to as a set of other objects on the basis of an attribute.

#### Example

* _biggest_


Note : most adjectives and adverbs in Naija do not have a `Degree` feature because comparatives and superlatives are based on [serial verb constructions](pcm-dep/compound:svc), e.g. _fine pass_, _fine pass all_.
