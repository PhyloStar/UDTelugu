Latvian features case for nouns ([`NOUN`](), [`PROPN`]()), adjectives ([`ADJ`]()), some numerals ([`NUM`]()), some participles ([`VERB`]() with [`VerbForm=Part`](VerbForm)) and some pronouns ([`PRON`]() and [`DET`]()).

Values used:

* `Nom` (nominative)
*	`Acc` (accusative)
*	`Dat` (dative)
*	`Gen` (genitive)
* `Loc` (locative)
*	`Voc` vocative) - mostly for nouns, sometimes hard to distinguish from nominative.

Theoretically possible values:

*	Ins (instrumental) - described in literature and used in older texts, however, in contemporary language has turned an analytical form, consisting of preposition _ar_ "with" and singular accusative or plural dative. Rare cases of preposition-less instrumentals are not distinguished from accusatives/datives.
