Latvian features number for nouns ([`NOUN`](), [`PROPN`]()), adjectives ([`ADJ`]()), some numerals ([`NUM`]()), verbs ([`VERB`]()) and some pronouns ([`PRON`]() and [`DET`]()).

Values used:

* `Sing` (singular number)
* `Plur` (plural number)
* `Ptan` (plurale tantum)
* `Coll` (collective / mass / singulare tantum) - might be used unevenly as it is hard distinguish from `Sing`

Theoretically possible values:

* `Dual` (dual number) - older texts feature forms like _abi roki_ "both hands", however it is so rare in contemporary language that it is absent from corpus.

Values not present in Latvian:

* `Tri` (trial number)
* `Pauc` (paucal number)
* `Grpa` (greater paucal number)
* `Grpl` (greater plural number)
* `Inv` (inverse number)
