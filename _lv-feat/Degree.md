Latvian features degree for adjectives ([`ADJ`]()), some participles ([`VERB`]() with [`VerbForm=Part`](VerbForm)) and some adverbs ([`ADV`]()). Ordinal numerals usually have first degree (_pirmais_ "the first"), however in informal language ordinal numeral forms with higher degrees can be formed (_pirmākais_, _vispirmākais_). Such informal cases are not correctly represented in this treebank.

Valus used:

* `Pos` (positive, first degree)
* `Cmp` (comparative, second degree)
* `Sup` (superlative, third degree)

Values not present in Latvian:

* `Equ` (equative)
* `Abs` (absolute superlative)
