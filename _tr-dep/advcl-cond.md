In Turkish conditional clauses are formed by a verbal inflection on the head of the clause. 
There are also two redundant words, _eğer_ and _şayet_ that may be included at the beginning or end of the phrase.
Use of these words are only for emphasis or an early signal that a conditional clause follows.
We use [discourse]() (not [mark]()) for marking the relation between these words and head of the conditional clause.
