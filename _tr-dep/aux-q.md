This is a subtype of [aux](), used for question particle _-mI (mı/mi/mu/mü)_.

The question particle, when attached to a predicate,
typically carries some of the tense/aspect/modality suffixes as well as person/number agreement suffixes.

Although it does not function as an auxiliary when attached to non-predicate words or phrases,
we use `aux:q` for all uses of the question particle.

**Annotation of question particles are not well-specified in UD, and currently under discussion.**
