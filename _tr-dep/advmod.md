An adverbial modifier of a word is a (non-clausal) [adverb](tr-pos/ADV) or adverbial phrase that serves to modify the meaning of the word.

Note that nouns in particular morphological [cases](tr-feat/Case),
or followed by an [adposition](tr-pos/ADP) are marked using [nmod]() even if they function as adverbial modifiers.

We use a special label, [tr-dep/advmod:emph]() for adverbial modifiers that are used for emphasis.
