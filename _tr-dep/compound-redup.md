shortdef: 'reduplicated compounds'

This subtype of [compound]() covers a range of reduplicated forms in Turkish.
Reduplication is a common process especially for [adverbs](tr-pos/ADV) and [adjectives](tr-pos/ADJ),
but it is also used for reduplicated [noun](tr-pos/NOUN) and [verb](tr-pos/VERB) forms.

The reduplication typically involves two identical words,
but some morpho-phonological alternations (as in m-reduplication in example 3 below) are possible.
In some cases one of the words in reduplicated forms may also be modified individually by other words (see example 4 below).
