**This needs more discussion**

This subtype of [nmod]() is used for marking the owner of a possessive existential sentence.

In Turkish possessive sentences (e.g., "I have a book") resemble existential sentences
where the subject is the entity that "exists", or "owned".
`nmod:own` relation marks the entity that "owns" the subject.
The head of the relation is the predicate,
as opposed to the subject noun phrase
(this allows a uniform analysis in case the subject is dropped).
It should not be confused with [nmod:poss](nmod-poss),
which is used in (genitive-)possessive constructions.
