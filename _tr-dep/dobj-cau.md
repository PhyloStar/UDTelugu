title: 'dobj:cau'
shortdef: 'direct object of an intransitive causative verb'
---

This is a subtype of [obj]().
We mark direct objects of causative [voice](tr-dep/Voice) intransitive verbs with this subtype,
since the interpretation is different in comparison to a direct object of a non-causative verb.
In general, if the verb is intransitive, direct object indicates the "causee",
the subject of the content verb, or the entity that performs the action.
If the verb is transitive the direct object is the entity that is acted upon as in the non-causative case (see [nmod:cau](nmod-cau)).
