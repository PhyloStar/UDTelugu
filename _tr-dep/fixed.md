The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is one of the three relations ([compound](), `fixed`, [flat]()) for compounding.
It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave like function words or short adverbials.

Note that, we mark most of the expressions that are marked `MWE` in METU-Sabancı treebank as `compound`. 
`fixed` is only used for fixed expressions that do not show any morphological variation.
