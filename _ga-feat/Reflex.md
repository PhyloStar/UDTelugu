###  `Yes` : it is reflexive 

The reflexive form is a feature of pronouns or determiners. It tells whether the word is reflexive, i.e. it refers to the subject of its clause.

In Irish, the reflexive pronoun is <b>féin</b>

#### Examples

* _bhí fhios agam cheana <b>féin</b>_ "I (myself) already knew"
* _bhí a chiall <b>féin</b> do gach duine ina thaibhreamh <b>féin</b>_ "Everybody's <b>own</b> meaning was in his <b>own</b> dream"
