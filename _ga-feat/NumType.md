Irish numeral forms inflect to demonstrate different grammatical roles. 

### `Card` : cardinal numbers

Cardinal numbers can be divided into those without nouns (used in counting, giving the time, etc.), and those with nouns. Those used without nouns use a particle _<b>a</b>_ that is absent in those used with nouns. This particle triggers h-prefix in numbers beginning with a vowel (_aon, ocht_).

#### Examples

##### Counting, etc.:
* _<b>a h</b>aon_ "one"
* _<b>a</b> seacht_ "seven"
* _<b>a</b> sé a chlog_ "six o' clock"

##### Numbers qualifying nouns:
* _<b>dhá</b> b<b>h</b>liain_ "two years"
* _<b>naoi</b> <b>g</b>capall <b>déag</b>_ "nineteen horses"
* _<b>seasca</b> punt_ "sixty pounds"

### `Pers` : personal numerals

The personal numerals are used for counting people. From numbers 1-12 this system of counting differs from that used with other nouns, after that, the form is the same as the cardinal form, or a combination of the two forms.

#### Examples

* _duine <b>amháin</b>_ "<b>one</b> person"
* _<b>beirt</b>_ "two people"
* _<b>aon</b> b<b>h</b>ean <b>dhéag</b>_ "eleven women"
* _<b>seasca</b> fear_ "sixty men"

### `Ord` : ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers can be used to show order of items. In Irish, the form uses the definite article _an_. (see [Definite]()). The English abbreviation "th" appended to a numeral (as in eigh<b>th</b>), is given in Irish as _<b>-ú</b>_.

#### Examples

* _<b>an chéad</b> lá_ "the first day"
* _<b>an dara</b> dóigh_ "the second prospect"
* _<b>an 17ú</b> Marta_ "the 17th of March"
