In Irish, verb form is a feature of words which have the appearance of a verb, although they function as other parts of speech. 
This feature appears most commonly as an `infinitive` construction, which functions as a noun. This feature also appears as a `copula`, a `particle` or a `verbal noun`.

### `Inf` : infinitive

The infinitive verb form is the same as the verbal noun. The infinitive is always preceded by the infinitive particle _<b>a</b>_. This particle causes lenition in the verb, where possible (see [Form]()).

#### Examples

##### Introduced by particle
* _<b>a</b> d<b>h</b>éanamh_ "to do"
* _<b>a</b> c<b>h</b>ur_ "to put"
* _<b>a</b> rá_ "to talk"

##### Introduced by preposition
* _le déanamh_ "to do"
* _chun féachaint_ "to see"
* _á rá_ "being said/saying"

### `Cop` : copula

The copula verb form usually functions as a copula verb, though it can also be used as a mark, to introduce a complement clause, or as the root of the sentence. The order of elements in a copula construction is in general: copula, predicate (new or focussed information), and subject. 

#### Examples

* _<b>Is</b> mise Briain_ "I <b>am</b> Brian"
* _<b>Is</b> é an watt (W) an t-aonad cumhachta_ "The watt (W) is the unit of power"

In the Irish treebank, the copula verb usually appears in its present tense form _is_, but has many other forms. It can combine wih other subordinate conjuctions or negative particles to form contractions, such as <b>gur</b>, <b>ba</b>, <b>ní</b>, etc. Also, the form of the verb _bí_ changes with respect to tense, mood and context (see [Form](ga/feat/all.html#vf--vowel-form)).

* _<b>Dá</b> mba mise thú_ "If I <b>were</b> you"
* _<b>Más</b> rud é_ "<b>if</b> it <b>is</b> a thing"
* _<b>Ar</b> mhaith leat_ "<b>would</b> you like?"
* _Dúirt sé <b>gur</b> múinteoir é_ "He said that he <b>was</b> a teacher"

### `Part` : participle

The participle verb form indicates a verbal adjective. It can be used to modify the head noun, or to introduce an adjectival predicate complement. (see [xcomp:pred](ga-dep/xcomp:pred)) The participle is usually inflected by adding the suffix <b>-te</b> (<b>-the</b>) or <b>-ta</b> (<b>-tha</b>) to the lemma. 

#### Examples

##### Adjectival modifier
* _Gaeilge <b>briste</b>_ "<b>broken</b> Irish"
* _na ndaoine <b>fásta</b>_ "the adults" _lit. "the <b>grown</b> people"_
* _Dé Domhnaigh seo <b>caite</b>_ "this <b>past</b> Sunday"

* _Tá gearán <b>déanta</b> ag Unison_ "Unison have <b>made</b> a complaint"
* _An mothaíonn tú <b>sábháilte</b>?_ "Do you feel <b>safe</b>?"
* _Tá a lán <b>scríofa</b> ar an ábhar seo_ "There's a lot <b>written</b> on this topic"

### `Vnoun` : verbal noun

Verbal nouns are similar to an infinitive verb in English, however they function as a noun rather than a verb. They may be used to introduce a clausal complement, (see [xcomp](ga-dep/xcomp)), as a conjunct, or as a root of the sentence. The noun is preceded by the preposition <b>ag</b> which loosely translates to "in the process of" in this context. The object of the verbal noun is in the genitive case (see [Case](ga/feat/all.html#gen--genitive-case)).

#### Examples

* _Beidh Máire Andrews <b>ag insint</b> scéalta difriúla_ "Mary Andrews will be <b>telling</b> different stories"
* _Bhí Bhreandán <b>ag caitheamh</b> a chuid airgid_ "Brendan was <b>spending</b> his money"
* _Bhí Éamonn <b>ag obair</b> go lánaimsireach_ "Eamon was <b>working</b> full-time"
