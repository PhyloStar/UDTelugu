There is no word for "yes" or "no" in Irish. Instead, a negative particle is used in combination with the verb to give a negative polarity. 

### `Neg` : negative

The negative particle _ní_* can be used in almost every tense, except the past. It causes lenition to relevant consonants (see [Form]()), otherwise there is no change. In the past tense the particle is written as _níor_, and does not trigger any further lenition, though the word may already be lenited due to past tense morphology (see [Tense]()). 

*In the Ulster dialect, this particle also appears as _cha_ (see [Dialect]())

#### Examples

* _<b>Ní</b> thuigim_ "I <b>don't</b> understand"
* _<b>Níor</b> ól sé_ "He <b>didn't</b> drink"

The interrogative negative particle _nach_ is used to pose a negative question, or to introduce a clausal complement (see [PartType]()).

#### Examples

* _<b>Nach</b> bhfuil tú?_ "Aren't you?"
* _Dhaoine <b>nach</b> ndearna scannán riamh_ "People who haven't ever made a film"

The verb "to be" (in Irish _bí_) is given the negative form _níl_ in the present tense, as a contraction of _ní bhfuil_. It can inflect to show (for instance) person.

#### Examples

* _<b>Níl</b> sé sin mí-réasúnta_ "That <b>is not</b> unreasonable"
* _Ach <b>nílirse</b> sásta_ "But <b>you aren't</b> happy"
