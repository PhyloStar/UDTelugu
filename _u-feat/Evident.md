Evidentiality is the morphological marking of a speaker's source of information
(Aikhenvald, 2004). It is sometimes viewed as a category of mood and modality.

Many different values are attested in the world's languages. At present we only
cover the firsthand vs. non-firsthand distinction, needed in Turkish.
It distinguishes there the normal past tense (firsthand, also definite past tense,
seen past tense) from the so-called _miş_-past (non-firsthand, renarrative,
indefinite, heard past tense).

Aikhenvald also distinguishes _reported_ evidentiality, occurring in Estonian
and Latvian, among others. We currently use the quotative [Mood]() for this.

Note: `Evident` is a new universal feature in UD version 2. It was used as
a language-specific feature (under the name `Evidentiality`) in UD v1 for Turkish.
