Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>young</b> man_
* [cs] _<b>mladý</b> muž_

### <a name="Equ">`Equ`</a>: equative

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object, and the result is that they are identical or similar (“as X as”).
Note that it marks the adjective and it is distinct from the equative [Case](),
which marks the standard of comparison.

#### Examples

* [et] _<b>pikkune</b> (pikkus+ne)_ “as tall as”

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* [en] _the man is <b>younger</b> than me_
* [cs] _ten muž je <b>mladší</b> než já_

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

* [en] _this is the <b>youngest</b> man in our team_
* [cs] _toto je <b>nejmladší</b> muž v našem týmu_

### <a name="Abs">`Abs`</a>: absolute superlative

Some languages can express morphologically that the studied quality of
the given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object
exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular
set of objects.

#### Examples

* [es] _guapo_ "handsome"; _<b>guapísimo</b>_ "<b>indescribably
  handsome</b>"
