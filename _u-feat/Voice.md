Voice is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB).
It may also occur with other parts of speech
([nouns](u-pos/NOUN), [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [adverbs](u-pos/ADV)),
depending on whether borderline word forms such as gerunds and participles
are classified as verbs or as the other category.

For Indo-European speakers, voice means mainly the active-passive
distinction. In other languages, other shades of verb meaning are
categorized as voice.

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object
is affected by the action (patient).

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>Napadli</b> jsme nepřítele._ “We <b>attacked</b> the enemy”
  (the active participle _napadli_ can be used to form either past
  tense or conditional mood; here it forms the past tense.)

### <a name="Mid">`Mid`</a>: middle voice

Between active and passive, needed e.g. in Ancient Greek or Sanskrit.

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer
(agent) is either unexpressed or it appears as an object of the verb.

#### Examples

* [cs] _Jsme <b>napadeni</b> nepřítelem._ “We are <b>attacked</b> by
  the enemy” (the passive participle _napadeni_ is used to form
  passive in all tenses; here it forms the present passive.)

### <a name="Antip">`Antip`</a>: antipassive voice

In ergative-absolutive languages, an ergative subject is demoted to an absolutive subject.

### <a name="Dir">`Dir`</a>: direct voice

Used in direct-inverse voice systems, e.g. in North American languages.
Direct means that the argument that is higher in salience hierarchy is the subject.
Example hierarchy: human 1st person – 2nd – 3rd – non-human animate – inanimate.

### <a name="Inv">`Inv`</a>: inverse voice

Used in direct-inverse voice systems, e.g. in North American languages.
Inverse voice marking means that the argument lower in the hierarchy functions as subject.

### <a name="Rcp">`Rcp`</a>: reciprocal voice

#### Examples

* [tr] _<b>karıştı</b>_, _<b>tutuştular</b>_

### <a name="Cau">`Cau`</a>: causative voice

<A HREF="https://wiki.ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz/_media/user:zeman:treebanks:ttbankkl.pdf">Documentation</A>
of the METU Sabanci treebank classifies causative as voice (page 26).
Note that this is a feature of verbs. There are languages that have
also the causative case of nouns.

#### Examples

* [tr] _<b>karıştırıyor</b>_ "is confusing"
