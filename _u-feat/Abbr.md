Boolean feature. Is this an abbreviation? Note that the abbreviated
word(s) typically belongs to a part of speech other than [u-pos/X]().

Note: This feature is new in UD version 2. It was used as a language-specific addition in several treebanks in version 1.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is abbreviation

Examples: [en] _<b>etc.</b>, <b>J.</b>, <b>UK</b>_
