The UD Finnish annotation does not use the [u-pos/PART]() part of speech.
See [ADV](), [ADP](), [CCONJ](), [SCONJ](), [INTJ]() for tags applying to
words that have been termed "particles" in some descriptions of Finnish.

The FI_FTB-corpus follows the general UD documentation in recognizing
the particle as a part-of-speech category. The specification between PART,
ADV and ADP has been carried out as in
[ISK ยง 792](http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=792) (in Finnish).
