# Syntax

Uralic languages use the common dependencies quite widely...

## Indirect objects

The secondary and other n-ary arguments of verb besides dobj are often marked
with just nmod.

## Owner marked with case plus copula

It is common to mark owning with a copula and a case on owner. This is
annotated using the nmod:own specialised dependency in Uralic languages that
exhibit this structure. Structurally this expression type corresponds to
other nominal modifiers, but there may be syntactic diversions as well as
semantic specialisation.

## Genitive possession

When a possessor is marked by a genitive or similar case on the possessor,
nmod:poss dependency is used.

## Deverbalsâ€™ nominal arguments

In many Uralic languages, the verbs when derived retain the argument structure,
however, dependencies customarily would not mark multiple subject or object
dependencies within a sentence, the deverbal nominals will use nmod:gobj and
nmod:gsubj for objects and subjects respectively.

## Copular subjects and objects

In predicative or equative sentences the subjects are marked as nsubj:cop or 
csubj:cop for nominal and clausal subjects respectively.
