Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms.

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* _<b>Studuješ</b> na univerzitě.&nbsp;_ “<b>You study</b> at the university.”

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

Czech verbs (except for modal verbs) have imperative forms of the second person singular,
first person plural and second person plural.

#### Examples

* _<b>Studuj</b> na univerzitě!&nbsp;_ “<b>Study</b> at the university!”

### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.

Czech has present conditional and past conditional, both formed periphrastically using
the past participle of the content verb, and a special form of the [auxiliary verb](cs-pos/AUX)
_být._ The special form resembles forms of the historic _aorist tense,_ which disappeared from
Czech during the 15th century.

The past participle of the content verb is not marked as conditional
because it can also be used in past indicative.

#### Examples

* _Kdy<b>bych</b> byl chytrý, studoval <b>bych</b> na
  univerzitě.&nbsp;_ “If I <b>were</b> smart I <b>would</b> study at the
  university.”
