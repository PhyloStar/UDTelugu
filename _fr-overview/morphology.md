# Morphology

The French morphology follows the UD guidelines for POS tagging.

The corpus contains a lemma for each word. These were automatically generated using French lexicons but not systematically hand-verified. For words not found in the lexicons, lemmas have been added manually.

The corpus contains a limited number of morphological features. These include
- Number for nouns, adjectives, determiners, some pronouns, and finite verbs
- Gender for nouns, adjectives, determiners, some pronouns, and past participles
- Mood, Tense and VerbFrom for verbs,
- Definite for determiners.

These were automatically generated and have undergone only very limited validation and hand correction.
