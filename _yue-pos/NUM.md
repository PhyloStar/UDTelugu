### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, a pronoun or an adjective, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` regardless of syntactic function and regardless of whether they are expressed as words (五 / _ng5_ "five") or digits (5). By contrast, ordinal numerals (such as 第一 / _dai6jat1_ "first") are always tagged <a>`ADJ`</a>.

### Examples

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100, 10,358, 5.23, 3/4
- 一 / _jat1_ "one", 二 / _ji6_ "two", 三 / _saam1_ "three", 一百 / _jat1baak3_ "one hundred", 五十六 / _ng5sap6luk6_ "fifty-six", 一萬三百五十八 / _jat1maan6saam1baak3ng5sap6baat3_ "ten thousand three hundred and fifty-eight", 四分之三 / _sei3fan6zi1saam1_ "three-quarters"
