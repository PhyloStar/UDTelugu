### Definition

Adverbs (副詞 / _fu3ci4_) typically modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs for such categories as time, manner, degree, frequency, or negation.

- 你 <b>慢慢</b>/ADV 講/VERB / _nei5 <b>man6man6\*2</b> gong2_ "Speak <b>slowly</b>."
- 佢 <b>非常之</b>/ADV 開心/ADJ / _keoi5 <b>fei1soeng4zi1</b> hoi1sam1 "She is <b>extremely</b> happy."
- 佢哋 <b>好</b>/ADV <b>早</b>/ADV 起身/VERB / _keoi5dei5 <b>hou2</b> <b>zou2</b> hei2san1_ "They get up <b>very early</b>."

Some adverbs also modify clauses with conjunctive and discursive functions.

- 佢 <b>反而</b> 冇 同 我 講 / _keoi5 <b>faan2ji4</b> mou5 tung4 ngo5 gong2_ "He didn't tell me, <b>however</b>."
- 今日 <b>當然</b> 冇 人 喇 ／ _gam1jat6 <b>dong1yin4</b> mou5 jan4 laa1_ "<b>Of course</b> nobody's here today."

A small number of adverbs may also modify numerals and determiners, or nouns and pronouns.

- <b>差唔多</b> 五千 / _<b>caa1m4do1</b> ng5cin1_ "<b>almost</b> five thousand"
- <b>連</b> 佢 都 唔 去 嘑 / _<b>lin4</b> keoi5 dou1 m4 heoi3 laa3_ "<b>Even</b> he's not going."

There is a closed subclass of pronominal adverbs that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, demonstrative, etc. These should be treated as adverbs when modifying a predicate, but otherwise some of them can function as a nominal in the syntax, in which case they should be tagged <a>`PRON`</a>.

- 你 <b>點解</b> 唔 來 / _nei5 <b>dim2gaai2</b> m4 lei4_ "<b>Why</b> aren't you coming?"
- 我 係 <b>咁樣</b> 做 嘅 / _ngo5 hai6 <b>gam2joeng2</b> zou4 ge3_ "I do it <b>like this</b>."

Note that although some adverbs express temporal information, many common time expressions (e.g., 今日 / _gam1jat6_ 'today', 舊年 / _gau6nin4*2_ "last year", 夜晚 / _je6maan5_ "night") are actually nouns and should be tagged <a>`NOUN`</a>.
