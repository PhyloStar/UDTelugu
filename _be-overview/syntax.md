# Syntax

The data were labeled semi-automatically using the annotation projection from Russian. For that purpose, Russian data were annotated using UDpipe, converted into UD 2.0, and then checked manually.
Belarusian dependency relation tags were checked manually.

Several [language-specific subtypes](../dep/index.html) of the [universal dependency relations](../../u/dep/index.html) have been defined
to preserve the information on structures relevant for Russian.
