There is no such feature in Portuguese.

Similarly to [Gender]() (and to the African noun classes), animacy is
usually a lexical feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and inflectional feature
of other parts of speech ([pronouns](u-pos/PRON),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),
[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with
nouns. It is
independent of gender, therefore it is encoded separately in some
tagsets (e.g. all the Multext-East tagsets). On the other hand, in
Czech the (almost) only grammatical implications occur within the
masculine gender, which is why the PDT tagset does not have
animateness as separate feature and instead defines four genders:
masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine and neuter.  We
follow the two-feature approach used in Multext-East (many languages)
because it is safer.
