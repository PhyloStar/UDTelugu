`Case` is usually an inflectional feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and,
depending on language, other parts of speech ([pronouns](pt-pos/PRON),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),
[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with nouns. In some tagsets
it is also valency feature of [adpositions](u-pos/ADP) (saying that
the adposition requires its argument to be in that case).

Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence,
especially in free-word-order languages. For example, the nominative
and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,
while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be
distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

Since Portuguese is not a free-word-language, `case` is used only to describe ([pronouns](pt-pos/PRON) that inherited this feature from Latin.

We have three cases in Portuguese: nominative (`Nom`), dative (`Dat`) and accusative (`Acc`).

#### Examples

*  nominative _eu, ele, você, tu, nós_
  accusative _lo_ (in "visando dotá-lo de poderes"), _se_ (in "a copa que amanhã se disputa")
  dative _lhe, lhes_ (in "políticas que lhes dizem respeito")
