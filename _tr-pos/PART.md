### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word
or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of
other universal parts of speech.

We current use the POS tag `PART` for the word _değil_ "not" when used to negate a non-predicate word
If _değil_ modifies a predicate, it is marked as `VERB` since it functions as a copula and carries other verbal inflections as well.
