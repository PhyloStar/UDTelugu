### Definition

Turkish only has postpositions.
They occur after a complement noun phrase (or a nominal subordinate clause) and they form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

A number of postpositions in Turkish are complex,
derived from a closed set of nouns (see Göksel & Kerslake 2005, ch.17).
Examples include, _alt-ın-da_ "below", _arka-sı-nda_ "behind", _konu-su-nda_ "about".
We also mark these expressions as `ADP` when they are used as postpositions
(**TODO**: this requires discussion).

### Examples

- _Ali'ye <b>rağmen</b>_ "<b>despite</b> Ali"
- _Ali <b>için</b>_ "for Ali"
- _Kalabalığın <b>arasında</b>_ "between/within the crowd"
- _Ali'nin <b>dışında</b>_ "except Ali"
