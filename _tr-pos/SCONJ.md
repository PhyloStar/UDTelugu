### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. 
The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause.

In Turkish subordinate clauses are mainly formed by suffixation (see the discussion in [tr-overview/special-syntax]()).
However, there are a few words that form subordinate clauses, notably _ki_ and _diye_.
The question particle _mI_ (_mı/mi/mu/mü_) and clitic _dA_ (_da/de_) may also form subordinate clauses.
We also mark the words, such as _madem_ and _eğer_, that are syntactically and semantically redundant but signal beginning of a subordinate clause.

For _coordinating conjunctions,_ see [CCONJ]().

### Examples
