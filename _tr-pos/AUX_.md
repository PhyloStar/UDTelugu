### Definition

In Turkish the verbs _ol-_ and _bulun-_ and the question particle _mI_ (_mı/mi/mu/mü_) may function as auxiliary verbs.
We (currently) use the `AUX` for the question particle.
The verbs are marked as _ol-_ and _bulun-_ are always marked as `VERB`. 
The dependency label indicates their use (auxiliary, copula or content verb).

### Examples

* _Okumuş bulunduk_ "We have happened to read (it)"
* _Okuyor olacağım_ "I will be reading"
* _Okumuş muydun_ "Have you read (it)?"
* _Okuymuş olmaycak mıydın_ "Weren't you supposed to read (it)"
