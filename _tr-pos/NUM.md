### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by NUM whether they are expressed as words (four), digits (4) or Roman numerals (IV).

In Turkish numbers may get features [NumType](tr-feat/NumType)`=Ord` (ordinal) or `NumType=Dist` (distributive) through suffixation.

We also mark interrogative _kaç_ "how many" as `NUM`.

### Examples

- _0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3,14159265359_ 
- _I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV_
- _bir_ "one", _beş_ "five", _onbeş_ "fifteen"
- _kaç_ "how many", _kaçıncı_ "which one (of an ordered entities)", _kaçar_ "how many each"
