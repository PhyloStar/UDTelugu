### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or
part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.

Note that `PROPN` is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used
as names and that often exhibit special syntactic properties.
When other phrases or sentences are used as names, 
the component words retain their original tags.
For example, in _İstanbul Büyük Şehir Belediyesi_, 
_Büyük_ is [ADJ](), _Şehir_ and _Belediyesi_ are [NOUN]().

Acronyms of proper nouns, such as _TBMM_ and _NATO_, should be tagged `PROPN`.

### Examples

- _Ayşe_, _Ali_
- _Ankara_
- _NATO_, _BM_, _TBMM_
