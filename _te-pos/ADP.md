All post-positions. 

Some post-positions are:

కి, కు - indicating "to the" relationships, and typically indicate dative case suffix.   
ని,ను - accusative suffix, typically denoting the object of the sentence.  
[accusative suffix is optional for inanimate nouns]  
నించి/నుంచి from

అ, న, ని (ఇంట, పైన, అడుగున, పైని) (used only with nouns referring to time, place and direction)  
ద్వారా, గుండా  through (agent)  

Type 2 post-positions - these can also occur as independent words (typically as adverbial Nouns, which we tag as ADV)
