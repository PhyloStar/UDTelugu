* Negation that follows the verb
చెప్ప లేదు  
చేయ రాదు 
etc  
Note: Negation verbs can also occur by themselves. In such cases, they should be treated as verbs. 

I think we remove this page since we can treat such verbs as serial verb constructions. Moreover, by definition, verbs that do not occur by themselves are auxillary.
