This document is a placeholder for the language-specific documentation
for `X`.

From [UD Documentation](universaldependencies.org/u/pos/X.html):

> "The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. It should be used very restrictively.

A special usage of X is for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation flat:foreign is typically used in the syntactic analysis). This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal part-of-speech. For example, in he put on a large sombrero, sombrero is an ordinary NOUN."
