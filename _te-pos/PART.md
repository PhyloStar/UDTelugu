Description in [UD](http://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/PART.html):
> "Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech (e.g. adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions or auxiliary verbs). Particles may encode grammatical categories such as negation, mood, tense etc. Particles are normally not inflected, although exceptions may occur.

BhK lists the following as particles and as clitics at various parts. We consider these as PART, considering their role in the sentence.
