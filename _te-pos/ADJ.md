This document is a placeholder for the language-specific documentation
for `ADJ`.


**Adverbial adjectives**: అలాంటి, అటు వంటి, నిన్నటి 

**Basic Adjectives**: చెరి in చెరిసగం, తలా 

Whenever a adjective is uninflected, it is tagged as adjective. 
Whenever a adjective is in oblique stem, it is marked as NOUN or PRON. BhK calls it PRON. Should we simply tag as NOUN?

**Nominal adjectives** such as ఇంటి కప్పు are tagged as NOUN.

**Adjectives with a Pronominal suffix** (e.g., మంచివాడు, గొప్పవాడు) will be tagged NOUN, as it was also suggested in BhK.
