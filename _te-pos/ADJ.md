ADJ are indeclinable in Telugu, and they often occur immediately before nouns.

**Adverbial adjectives**: అలాంటి, అటు వంటి, నిన్నటి (Normally adverbs of time or manner, which modify nouns and become adjectives)
(e.g., నిన్న రాత్రి, నిన్నటి రాత్రి - both నిన్న and నిన్నటి are tagged ADJ)

**Basic Adjectives**: చెరి in చెరిసగం, తలా 

Whenever a adjective is uninflected, it is tagged as adjective. 
Whenever a adjective is in oblique stem, it is marked as NOUN or PRON. BhK calls it PRON. Should we simply tag as NOUN?

**Nominal adjectives** such as ఇంటి కప్పు are tagged as NOUN.

**Inflected Possessives** (e.g., నాది, వాళ్ళది etc) will be tagged as ADJ, as was suggested in BhK, and not as DET as described in UD. 

**Adjectives with a Pronominal suffix** (e.g., మంచివాడు, గొప్పవాడు, పెద్దది, చక్కనిది etc.) will be tagged NOUN, as it was also suggested in BhK.
