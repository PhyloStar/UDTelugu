ADJ are indeclinable in Telugu, and they often occur immediately before nouns.

**Basic Adjectives**: చెరి in చెరిసగం, తలా, ప్రతి, ఒక్కొక, 

Whenever a adjective is uninflected, it is tagged as adjective. 
Whenever a adjective is in oblique stem, it is marked as NOUN.

**Nominal adjectives** 
- adjectives derived from nouns (carrying oblique stem) such as ఇంటి కప్పు are tagged as NOUN, with nmod:poss relation. 
- TODO

**Adverbial adjectives**: అలాంటి, అటువంటి (Normally adverbs of time or manner, which modify nouns and become adjectives)
(Note: నిన్న రాత్రి, నిన్నటి రాత్రి - both నిన్న and నిన్నటి are not tagged ADJ, they are adverbial NOUNS.)

**Adjectives with a Pronominal suffix** (e.g., మంచివాడు, గొప్పవాడు, పెద్దది, చక్కనిది etc.), typically used to refer to a person, place or thing, will be tagged NOUN, as it was also suggested in BhK.
