Uninflected cardnial numbers (including fractions) are treated as NUM tag.
(e.g., ఒకటి, రెండు, మూడు, 4, IV  etc)  

In case of multi-word numeric expressions, all words are tagged NUM and connected by a FLAT dependency relation.

Since Numbers in Telugu can also function as ADJ, ADV and NOUN, Inflected numbers will be either of them depending on their syntactic function in the sentence.  

In ordinal numbers (e.g., number expressions in మొదటి రోజు, ఒక పాట etc.,) the number words function as ADJ to the following nouns and should be tagged such. [UD guidelines](http://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/NUM.html) suggest the same.
