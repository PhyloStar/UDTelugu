Uninflected Numbers (including fractions) are treated as NUM tag.

In case of multi-word numeric expressions, all words are tagged NUM and connected by a FLAT dependency relation.

Since Numbers in Telugu can also function as ADJ and NOUN, Inflected numbers will be either of them depending on their function in the sentence.
