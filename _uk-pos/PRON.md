### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

Pronouns under this definition function like nouns. Note that Ukrainian grammar traditionally extends the term _pronoun_ to words that
substitute for [adjectives](ADJ). Such words are not tagged `PRON` under our universal scheme. They are tagged as [determiners](DET) in order to annotate the same thing same way across languages.

For instance, _tohle&nbsp;_ “this” is traditionally called pronoun in Czech grammar, regardless of context (the notion of determiners does not exist in Ukrainian grammar). To make the annotation parallel across languages, it is now tagged `PRON` in _<b>Це</b> я бачила вчора.&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> yesterday.” and `DET` in _<b>Це</b> дерево я бачила вчора._&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> tree yesterday.”

### Examples

- personal pronouns: _я, ти, він, вона, воно, ми, ви, вони&nbsp;_ “I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they, they”
- reflexive pronouns: _себе, се, собі, собою&nbsp;_ “oneself”
- demonstrative pronouns: _це&nbsp;_ as in _<b>Це</b> я бачила вчора._ “I saw <b>this</b> yesterday.”
- interrogative pronouns: _хто, що&nbsp;_ “who, what” as in _<b>Що</b> ти думаєш?&nbsp;_ “<b>What</b> do you think?”
- relative pronouns: _хто, що&nbsp;_ “who, what” as in _Мене цікавить, <b>що</b> ти думаєш.&nbsp;_  “I wonder <b>what</b> you think.”
- indefinite pronouns: _дехто, дещо&nbsp;_ “somebody, something”
- total pronouns: _кожен, всі&nbsp;_ “everybody, all”
- negative pronouns: _ніхто, ніщо&nbsp;_ “nobody, nothing”
