### Definition

Ukrainian has only prepositions but no postpositions or circumpositions. They occur before a complement noun phrase (noun, pronoun) and they form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

Some prepositions take the form of fixed multiword expressions, e.g. _на відміну від&nbsp;_ “in contrast to”, _у&nbsp;зв'язку з&nbsp;_
“in connection with”. The component words are then still tagged according to their basic use (_на&nbsp;_ is `ADP`, _відміну&nbsp;_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

### Examples

- _в&nbsp;_ “in, at”
- _до&nbsp;_ “to”
- _протягом&nbsp;_ “during”
