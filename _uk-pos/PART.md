### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech (e.g. [adpositions](ADP), [coordinating conjunctions](CCONJ), or [subordinating conjunctions](SCONJ)).  Particles may encode grammatical categories such as negation, mood etc. Ukrainian particles are not inflected.

Note that response words such as _так&nbsp;_ “yes”, _ні&nbsp;_ “no”, etc. are considered particles in grammars of Ukrainian but they are tagged as interjections under the UD standard. Also note that _ні&nbsp;_ can be used in two ways, one would be translated as English “no” and the other as “nor”. Only the former should become interjection, while the latter will stay a conjunction.

### Examples

- Sentence modality: _<b>но</b>, <b>хай</b>, <b>нехай</b>&nbsp;_ (“<b>May you</b> have an enjoyable stay!”)
- _тільки&nbsp;_ “just, only”
- _аж&nbsp;_ “only, as late as, even, up to”
