### Description

Aspect is typically a feature of verbs. It may also occur with other parts of
speech (nouns, adjectives, adverbs), depending on whether borderline word forms
such as gerunds and participles are classified as verbs or as the other
category. Uralic verbs have mainly suffixes in tense-mood axis, but some may
also be annotated in `Aspect` category.

#### Examples

None in Finnish.
