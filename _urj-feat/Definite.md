### Description

Definiteness is typically a feature of nouns, adjectives and articles.
Definiteness is not an explicitly marked feature in most traditional Uralic
descriptions. Many uralic languages feature few ways of expressing
definiteness, such as partitive case, which is not marked using Definite
feature but just a Case. Definite exists in Hungarian as a feature for
indefinite and definite articles, as well as verbal suffixes.
