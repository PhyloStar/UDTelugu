Sentence particles, also commonly known as "sentence-final particles" in Chinese linguistics, occur at the end of clauses and sentences and have a wide range of functions including modifying the modality of a sentence or its proposition, and expressing discourse and pragmatic information. They are linked to the head of a sentence/utterance as `discourse:sp` dependents (we place them under an extension of `discourse` under a broad interpretation of the word "discourse").

Common sentence-final particles in Cantonese include: 嘅 _ge3_, 嘑 _laa3_, 喇 _laa1_, 囉 _lo4_, 唧 _zek1_, 吖 _aa1_, 喎 _wo3_, 呀嘛 _a1maa3_, 先 _sin1_, 添 _tim1_, among many others. Note that many sentence-final particles can be written in multiple ways and some characters can also represent different particles that differ only in tone; there is no official standard so the characters used here are not meant to be a definitive guide. 

For a list of tag particles that should not be confused with sentence-final particles, see [discourse]() and [PART]().
