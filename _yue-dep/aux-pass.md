The passive auxiliary is limited to the particle 被 _bei6_ used in a passive sentence structure where the agent is omitted. This usage is considered to be Mandarin in origin but is sometimes found in formal registers such as in newscasts.

The regular way to construct a passive structure in Cantonese involves the prepositional marker 畀 _bei2_ followed by an obligatory agent noun; see [obl:agent]() for details.
