The `compound:vo` relation is used for verb-object compounds where the combination is semantically one unit but syntactically separate. These are known as 離合詞 _lei4hap6ci4_ "separable words" in Chinese linguistics.

These compounds run the range of:

- (i) light verb constructions where the noun carries more semantic weight than the verb
  - e.g., 打␣電話 / _daa2-din6waa2_ hit-telephone "make a phone call" 
  - (equivalents of these in other languages may be labeled with `compound:lvc`) 
- (ii) neither the verb or noun can be considered the semantic head (i.e., an exocentric compound)
  - e.g., 讀␣書 / _duk6-syu1_ read-book "study"
- (iii) situations where the verb carries the semantic weight over a relatively empty noun or the noun is semantically redundant
  - e.g., 瞓␣覺 / _fan3-gaau3_ sleep(verb)-sleep(noun) "sleep"
  - in the example, the noun 覺 no longer has a modern lexical usage independently and the verb 睡 can be used on its own to convey the same meaning

All of the above cases have the same syntactic distribution, where the object behaves like a direct object of the verb. Verb-object compounds never take another object as direct object, and the object can be separated from the verb as in regular non-compound situations. 

For example, aspect markers as well as adverbials of duration and frequency, when present, come in between:

When undergoing verb-verb compounding (see [compound:vv]()), it is the verb in the verb-object compound that undergoes the compounding, rather than the entire verb-object unit, resulting in a VVO order instead of a VOV order:

# visual-style 2	bgColor:blue
# visual-style 2	fgColor:white
# visual-style 4	bgColor:blue

Additionally, the object in a verb-object compound may be modified (by an adjective or possessive), and also fronted to topic position (in which case the object is linked to the verb as a [dislocated:vo]() dependent):

Note that when both the verb and the object are monosyllabic and they are adjacent without intervening material, they are treated as a single word in the tokenization/word segmentation stage.
