## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `SYM` is 1.000000 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.812100).

The 1st highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “%”: <em>%</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “13%”: <em>13%</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “14%”: <em>14%</em>.

`SYM` occurs with 2 features: [hr-feat/NumType]() (21; 21% instances), [hr-feat/Case]() (1; 1% instances)

`SYM` occurs with 2 feature-value pairs: `Case=Gen`, `NumType=Mult`

`SYM` occurs with 3 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `_` (80 tokens).
Examples: <em>%, $</em>
