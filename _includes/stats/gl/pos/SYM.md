## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `SYM` is 1.000000 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.508250).

The 1st highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “%”: <em>%</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “&”: <em>&</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “*”: <em>*</em>.

`SYM` does not occur with any features.


## Relations

`SYM` nodes are attached to their parents using 7 different relations: [gl-dep/nmod]() (300; 63% instances), [gl-dep/punct]() (156; 33% instances), [gl-dep/amod]() (6; 1% instances), [gl-dep/obj]() (6; 1% instances), [gl-dep/nsubj]() (3; 1% instances), [gl-dep/ccomp]() (2; 0% instances), [gl-dep/xcomp]() (1; 0% instances)

Parents of `SYM` nodes belong to 7 different parts of speech: [NUM]() (320; 68% instances), [NOUN]() (104; 22% instances), [VERB]() (25; 5% instances), [PROPN]() (14; 3% instances), [ADJ]() (8; 2% instances), [PRON]() (2; 0% instances), [ADP]() (1; 0% instances)
