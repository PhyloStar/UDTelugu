## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `SYM` is 1.000000 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.485733).

The 1st highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “%”: <em>%</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “&”: <em>&</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “+”: <em>+</em>.

`SYM` does not occur with any features.
