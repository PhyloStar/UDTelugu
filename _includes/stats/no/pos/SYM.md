## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `SYM` is 0.909091 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.383513).

The 1st highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “$/”: <em>/</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “+”: <em>+</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “+5°C”: <em>+5°C</em>.

`SYM` does not occur with any features.


## Relations

`SYM` nodes are attached to their parents using 6 different relations: [no-dep/compound]() (59; 84% instances), [no-dep/conj]() (4; 6% instances), [no-dep/root]() (4; 6% instances), [no-dep/flat:name]() (1; 1% instances), [no-dep/obl]() (1; 1% instances), [no-dep/orphan]() (1; 1% instances)

Parents of `SYM` nodes belong to 8 different parts of speech: [NOUN]() (32; 46% instances), [PROPN]() (19; 27% instances), [CCONJ]() (5; 7% instances), [ROOT]() (4; 6% instances), [SYM]() (4; 6% instances), [ADJ]() (3; 4% instances), [NUM]() (2; 3% instances), [VERB]() (1; 1% instances)

60 (86%) `SYM` nodes are leaves.

7 (10%) `SYM` nodes have one child.

1 (1%) `SYM` nodes have two children.

2 (3%) `SYM` nodes have three or more children.

The highest child degree of a `SYM` node is 3.
