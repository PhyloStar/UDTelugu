## Treebank Statistics (UD_Slovenian)

This feature is language-specific.
It occurs with 3 different values: `Dual`, `Plur`, `Sing`.

This is a <a href="../../u/overview/feat-layers.html">layered feature</a> with the following layers: [Number](), [Number[psor]]().

733 tokens (1%) have a non-empty value of `Number[psor]`.
120 types (0%) occur at least once with a non-empty value of `Number[psor]`.
11 lemmas (0%) occur at least once with a non-empty value of `Number[psor]`.
The feature is used with 1 part-of-speech tags: [sl-pos/DET]() (733; 1% instances).

### `DET`

733 [sl-pos/DET]() tokens (16% of all `DET` tokens) have a non-empty value of `Number[psor]`.

The most frequent other feature values with which `DET` and `Number[psor]` co-occurred: <tt><a href="PronType.html">PronType</a>=Prs</tt> (732; 100%), <tt><a href="Poss.html">Poss</a>=Yes</tt> (732; 100%), <tt><a href="Number.html">Number</a>=Sing</tt> (514; 70%), <tt><a href="Person.html">Person</a>=3</tt> (461; 63%).

`DET` tokens may have the following values of `Number[psor]`:


`Number[psor]` seems to be **lexical feature** of `DET`. 100% lemmas (11) occur only with one value of `Number[psor]`.
