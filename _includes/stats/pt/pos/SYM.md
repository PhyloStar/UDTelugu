## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `SYM` is 1.000000 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.425915).

The 1st highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “%”: <em>%</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “-”: <em>-</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “CR$”: <em>CR$</em>.

`SYM` occurs with 2 features: [pt-feat/Gender]() (384; 99% instances), [pt-feat/Number]() (384; 99% instances)

`SYM` occurs with 3 feature-value pairs: `Gender=Masc`, `Number=Plur`, `Number=Sing`

`SYM` occurs with 3 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `Gender=Masc|Number=Plur` (376 tokens).
Examples: <em>%, US$, R$, CR$</em>
