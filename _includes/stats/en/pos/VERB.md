## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `VERB` is 1.866667 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.181137).

The 1st highest number of forms (13) was observed with the lemma “be”: <em>'m, 's, am, are, be, been, being, is, m, s, was, were, ’s</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (6) was observed with the lemma “bear”: <em>bear, beared, bearing, bears, bore, born</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (6) was observed with the lemma “know”: <em>knew, know, knowing, known, knows, no</em>.

`VERB` occurs with 6 features: [en-feat/VerbForm]() (25840; 100% instances), [en-feat/Tense]() (14101; 55% instances), [en-feat/Mood]() (10305; 40% instances), [en-feat/Number]() (2141; 8% instances), [en-feat/Person]() (2127; 8% instances), [en-feat/Voice]() (1319; 5% instances)

The 1st highest number of forms (8) was observed with the lemma “be”: <em>'s, are, be, been, being, is, was, were</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (6) was observed with the lemma “have”: <em>ad, h, had, has, have, having</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (5) was observed with the lemma “begin”: <em>began, begin, beginning, begins, begun</em>.

`VERB` occurs with 5 features: [en-feat/VerbForm]() (3600; 100% instances), [en-feat/Tense]() (2399; 67% instances), [en-feat/Mood]() (1327; 37% instances), [en-feat/Person]() (975; 27% instances), [en-feat/Number]() (936; 26% instances)

`VERB` occurs with 14 feature-value pairs: `Mood=Imp`, `Mood=Ind`, `Mood=Sub`, `Number=Plur`, `Number=Sing`, `Person=1`, `Person=2`, `Person=3`, `Tense=Past`, `Tense=Pres`, `VerbForm=Fin`, `VerbForm=Ger`, `VerbForm=Inf`, `VerbForm=Part`

`VERB` occurs with 28 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `Tense=Past|VerbForm=Part` (887 tokens).
Examples: <em>based, made, given, taken, adopted, used, entitled, written, done, published</em>
