The passive auxiliary is limited to the particle 被 _bèi_ in the "short passive" construction, where the agent is not mentioned.

"Long passive" constructions where 被 _bèi_ is followed by a noun expressing the agent are considered adpositional phrases, in which case the relation [obl:agent]() is used and 被 _bèi_ is annotated as a [case]() dependent with an ADP tag. Etymologically, the two passive constructions appear to have likely followed different grammaticalization paths, hence the different treatments in the tagging and annotation of the two.
