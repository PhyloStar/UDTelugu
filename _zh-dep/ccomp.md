A clausal complement is a full clause that functions like an object of verb. It has its own subject and it is not obligatorily coreferent with any of the arguments of the matrix verb (for more on "obligatory control", see [xcomp]()).

The subject of the embedded clause may sometimes be absent, but pragmatically understood, such as in the below example where the thing being mentioned as being stinky may be a room or a pair of socks that was previously discussed or known to be the topic of discussion.

In some rare cases, a verb may have different meanings, one taking a `ccomp` dependent, and another an `xcomp` dependent. For example, the verb 覺得 _juédé_ may mean "feel, think, consider" or "feel a sensation". The first meaning takes a clausal complement, as in example (2) above; the second meaning requires `xcomp`, as in (3) below, which exhibits a case of "subject control", where the subject of the second predicate 很 開心 / _hěn kāixīn_ "very happy" is necessarily understood as the subject of the matrix verb 覺得 / _juédé_ "feel (a sensation)".

Additionally, `ccomp` is used for "extent compounds" (see [compound:ext]()) where a clause with its own subject follows V + 得 (for a subjectless predicate following V + 得, [xcomp]() is used).

The `ccomp` relation is also used for the copula 是 _shì_ when its argument is a clause (although in copular constructions, 是 _shì_ is a [cop]() dependent of the predicate when the predicate is non-clausal).

### 是...(的) constructions

The cleft-like focus constructions involving 是 _shì_ and 是...的 _shì...de_ are treated similarly to copular constructions with a clausal complement illustrated in (5).  In these constructions 是 _shì_ is considered the head, and the verb phrase or clause following it its clausal complement. Any noun phrase or adverbial to the left of 是 _shì_ is treated as a [dislocated]() dependent of 是 _shì_ (rather than subject, adjunct, or oblique nominal of the complement clause), unless the adverbial is meant to modify 是 _shì_ itself. Note that clausal subjects to the left of 是 _shì_ are also treated as [dislocated](). The sentence-final particle 的 _de_ is attached to the complement clause (although note that 的 _de_ may also be a nominalizer or a genitive marker on a nominal predicate depending on the context).

### Subject-less `ccomp` vs. subject-control `xcomp`

It may be difficult sometimes to differentiate between (i) `ccomp` with the subject of the complement clause (non-obligatorily) dropped and (ii) a case of subject-control `xcomp` where the subject is obligatorily absent.

One can reinsert a subject into the complement clause as a test to separate the above two situations. If the result is perfectly grammatical AND the meaning of the matrix verb does not change, it is likely situation (i) where the clausal complement should be linked to the matrix verb with `ccomp` (as shown in 2’ below). Otherwise, if the sentence becomes ungrammatical OR the meaning of the matrix verb changes, then it would likely be situation (ii) with `xcomp` (as shown in 3’ below). In the following sentences, the reinserted subjects are emphasized, the matrix verbs italicized, and the complement clauses in brackets:

- (2’)
- 你 有 否 <i>覺得</i> [<b>房間</b> 很 臭]？ (cf. 2)
- 2SG AUX NEG <i>think</i> [<b>room</b> very stinky]
- "Do you think the room is very stinky?"
  - grammatical
  - AND matrix verbs in (2) and (2’) have the same meaning 	
  - CONCLUSION: matrix verb 覺得 'think' in (2) → `ccomp`
- 
- (3’)
- 我 <i>覺得</i> [<b>我</b> 很 開心] (cf. 3)
- 1SG <i>think</i> [<b>1SG</b> very happy]
- "I think I’m very happy" (Unavailable: "I feel very happy" as seen in (3))
  - grammatical
  - BUT matrix verbs in (3) and (3’) have different meanings ("feel" vs. "think", respectively)
  - CONCLUSION: matrix verb 覺得 'feel' in (3) → `xcomp`

See [xcomp]() for another test for differentiating between `ccomp` and object-control `xcomp`.
