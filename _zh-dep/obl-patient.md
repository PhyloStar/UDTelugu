The relation `obl:patient` is used for the Mandarin "BA construction" (also known as the "disposal construction"). Objects marked (and raised to preverbal-position) by 把 _bǎ_ or the more formal version 將 _jiāng_ take the main verb as their head, while the objects themselves serve as the head of 把 _bǎ_ or 將 _jiāng_ (tagged as ADP).
