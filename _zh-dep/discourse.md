The discourse relation is used for interjections (words tagged [INTJ]()) and other discourse particles or words which are not clearly linked to the syntactic structure of the sentence except in a discursive sense. However, if an interjected element is clausal (including tag questions and words with a sentence-final particle or single words that are verbs or predicate adjectives), it should be given the relation [parataxis]().
