### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of
other universal parts of speech. Particles may encode grammatical categories such as negation, mood, tense etc.  Particles are normally not inflected, although exceptions may occur.

### The particles of Naija include :

- na (copulative particle of focalization, marker of cleft clause) : <b>Na</b> our work we dey do.
- no (negation) : and im <b>no</b> suppose be like dat.
- to : And make we try drive <b>to</b> stay alive.
