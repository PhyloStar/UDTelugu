### Definition

Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class.

Numerals are annotated as [NUM]() and possessive pronouns are annotated as [PRON]().
