### Definition

An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality.
Auxiliaries can be combined with any other verb (unlike serialized verbs which can only form some specific combinations) to express time, aspect or mood.
Auxiliaries can be root.
