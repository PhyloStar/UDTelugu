(**New proposal**)

`Evidential`ity is a feature of [verbs](tr-pos/VERB).
It indicates the source of evidence for a given statement. 
It is often classified as a mood,
but some linguists considers it an additional dimension alongside [Tense]()/[Aspect]()/[Moodality](Mood).

Non-first-hand evidentiality is generally marked the suffix *-mIş*.
However, in combination with other morphemes,
*-mIş* does not necessarily mark evidentiality.

### `Fh`: first hand

This is the default. 
The speaker has first-hand evidence for the statement/event.

#### Examples
(cf. the same examples below for `Nfh`)

* _eve gitti_ 'she/he went home'
* _eve gidecek_ 'she/he will go home'
* _eve gidiyor_ 'she/he is going home'
* _eve gimeli_ 'she/he has to go home'
* _eve gimişti_ 'she/he had gone home'

### `Nfh`: non-first hand

The speaker has indirect evidence for the statement.

#### Examples

* *eve gitmiş*  '(evidently) she went home'
* *eve gidecekmiş* '(evidently) she will go home'
* *eve gidiyormuş* '(evidently) she is going home (now)'
* *eve gitmeliymiş* '(evidently) she has to go home'
* *eve gitmemişmiş* '(evidently) she had gone home (by the time I arrived)'
