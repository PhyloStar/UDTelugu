In Turkish, `Person` is a feature of personal [pronouns](tr-pos/PRON), and [verbs](tr-pos/VERB).
`Person` marking on verbs are obligatory in Turkish for all finite verb forms.
The `Person` marker on predicates indicate the subject when there is
no overt subject.


The verbal markers for person and number are composite, and their form change
depending on the other suffixes attached to the verb.

The person/number marker of verbs may also be attached to the question particle *-mI* (*-mi/mı/mu/mü*), which is written separately.

METU-Sabancı treebank marks all nouns as having 3rd person agreement marker.
We do not mark nouns for `Person`.

### `1`: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. 

It is used for pronouns *ben* 'I' and *biz* 'we' and their inflected forms, and verbs with a first person  plural/singular agreement suffix.

#### Examples

* *<b>ben</b>* 'I'
* *<b>ben</b>imle* 'with me'
* *<b>biz</b>imki* 'the one that belongs to us'
* *(ben) okudu<b>m</b>* 'I read-PAST' -- note the optionality of the subject
* *(biz) okuyacağ<b>ız</b>* 'We read-FUT'


### `2`: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

It is used for pronouns *sen* 'you-SING' and *siz* 'you-PLU' and their inflected forms, and verbs with a second person  plural/singular agreement suffix.

The second person singular agreement suffix is null for verbs in imperative form.

#### Examples

* *<b>sen</b>i* 'you(SG)-ACC'
* *<b>siz</b>inle* 'with you(PL)'
* *<b>siz</b>de* 'you(PL)-LOC - on/at you(PL)'
* *oku!* 'read!'
* *(sen) okudu<b>n</b>* 'you(SG) read-PAST'
* *(siz) okuyacak<b>sınız</b>* 'you(PL) read-FUT'


### `3`: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

It is used for pronouns *o* 'he/she/it' and *onlar* 'they' and their inflected forms, and verbs with a second third plural/singular agreement suffix. The third person singular agreement suffix is null in most cases. 

#### Examples

* *<b>o</b>na* 'he/she/it-DAT'
* *<b>onlar</b>la* 'with them'
* *(o) okudu* 'he/she read-PAST'
* *(onlar) okudu(<b>lar</b>)* 'they read-PAST' -- note the optionality of the  agreement on the verb
* *okudu<b>lar</b>* 'they read-PAST'
