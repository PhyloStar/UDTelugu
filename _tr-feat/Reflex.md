It tells whether the word is reflexive, i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.

This marks the reflexive pronoun _kendi_ and its inflected forms.

### `Yes`: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the
`Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* _kendi_ "self" 
* _kendisi_ "himself/herself/itself" 
* _kendimiz_ "ourselves"
