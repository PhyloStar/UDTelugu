`Number` is an inflectional feature of nouns and other parts of speech (adjectives, verbs) that mark agreement with nouns.

In Turkish, nouns (NOUN, PROP, PRON) and verbs may have the feature `Number`.
Note that, the number agreement between a subject noun and the predicate is not straightforward.
Plural nouns agree with predicates with both singular an plural
marking,
but singular nouns disagree with predicates with plural marking.
When subject is present, the singular form of the verb is preferred.
Otherwise, obligatory the person/number agreement marker indicates the `Number` feature of the subject (as well as [Person]()).

In case plurality is indicated by a modifier, the noun does not get an explicit plural marker (see example 2 for `Sing`).

We mark `Number=Plur` only if there is an explicit morphological marker.

The `Nuber` feature should not be confused with [Number\[psor\]](Number_psor),
which indicates the whether possessor of a noun is singular or plural.

### `Sing`: singular number

A single person or thing. There is no morphological marker for singular for nouns and verbs in 3rd person singular form.

#### Examples

* *bir elma* 'one/an apple'
* *üc elma* 'three apples' -- note the missing plural marker. 
 _\*üç elma<b>lar</b>_ is ungrammatical.
* *okudum* '(I) read-PAST'

### `Plur`: plural number

More than one person or thing.
On nouns plurality is indicated by suffix *-lAr*.
Plurality on verbs is indicated by a set of person/number suffixes which vary depending on the previous suffixes.

#### Examples

* *elmal<b>lar</b>* 'apples'
* *okudu<b>k</b>* '(We) read-PAST'
* *Öğrenci<b>ler</b> kitap okuyacak(<b>lar</b>)* 'The students will read books' -- the plural marker on the verb is optional.
* *Kitap okuyacak<b>lar</b>* '(They) will read books' -- Plurality of the subject is inferred from the agreement marker on the verb
