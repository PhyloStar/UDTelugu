In Turkish [numbers](tr-pos/NUM) can be cardinal, ordinal or distributive.
We also mark the interrogative _kaç_ "how many" as a number,
which inflects the same way the numbers are inflected and can become ordinal or distributive.

### `Card`: cardinal number or corresponding interrogative

#### Examples

* _1, 2, 3_ 
* _bir, iki, üç_  "one, two, three"
* _kaç kitap okudun_ "how many books did your read"

### `Ord`: ordinal number or corresponding interrogative 

In some languages, this is a subtype of adjective or adverb.
In Turkish, we mark the ordinal numerals as `NUM`.

Ordinal numerals are formed by the suffix _-IncI_.
A period following a numeral may also indicate ordinal use of the number.

#### Examples

* _1., 2., 3._ 
* _bir<b>inci</b>, iki<b>nci</b>, üç<b>üncü</b>_  "first, second, third"
* _kaç<b>ıncı</b> kitabı okudun_ "which (of a series) book did your read" (answer should be something like _ikinci_ "(the) second")

### `Dist`: distributive numeral

Used to express that the same quantity is distributed to each member in a set of targets.

Distributive numerals are formed by the suffix _-(ş)Ar_.

#### Examples

* _bir<b>er</b>, iki<b>şer</b>, üç<b>er</b>_  "one each, two each, three each"
* _kaç<b>ar</b> kitap okudunuz_ "how many books have you each read"
