An open clausal complement (`xcomp`) of a verb or an adjective is a predicative or clausal complement without its own subject. The reference of the subject is necessarily determined by an argument external to the xcomp (normally by the object of the next higher clause, if there is one, or else by the subject of the next higher clause). These complements are always non-finite, and they are complements (arguments of the higher verb or adjective) rather than adjuncts/modifiers. The name `xcomp` is borrowed from Lexical-Functional Grammar. 

~~~ sdparse
Il dit que tu aimes nager \n He says that you like to swim
xcomp(aimes, nager)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Je compte y retourner \n I am planning to go back there
xcomp(compte, retourner)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Je le considère comme un ami \n I consider him as a friend
xcomp(considère, ami)
~~~

In FrenchSopken we also use the `xcomp`relation. Here are examples from FrenchSpoken:

~~~ sdparse
j' aimerais enseigner dans un établissement public \n I'd like to teach in a public school
xcomp(aimerais, enseigner)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
on pourrait imaginer des mélanges \n we could imagine some mixes
xcomp(pourrait, imaginer)
