The indirect object of a verb is a pronominal complement which corresponds to a dative object. In Italian the <code>iobj</code> only appears as clitic pronoun because when the indirect object is realized as a prepositional phrase, it is labeled as <code>nmod</code> (ex. *Dare a qualcuno qualcosa*, give something to someone).
