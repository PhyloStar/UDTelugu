This element is used for any piece of punctuation in a clause. 
The last punctuation mark of the sentence (usually a full stop or interrogative/exclamation point) always depends on the root; commas, apexes and punctuation elements depend on the head of the clause, or the complement, they refer to. In general, tokens with the relation <code>punct</code> always attach to content words (except in cases of ellipsis) and can never have dependents on their own.
