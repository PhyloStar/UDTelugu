The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is one of the three relations (<code>compound</code>, <code>mwe</code>, <code>name</code>) for compounding. It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave like function words or short adverbials. Any grammatical class can take part in a multiword expression, but usually they are a combination of adverbials and prepositions (usually *a* or *di*).

Some of the most common <code>mwe</code> for Italian are listed in the examples below.
