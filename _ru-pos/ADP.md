### Definition

Russian has only prepositions but not postpositionsand and circumpositions.
They occur before a complement noun phrase
(noun, pronoun)
and they form a single structure with the complement to express its
grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

Some prepositions take the form of fixed multiword expressions, e.g.
_по сравнению с_ “in comparison with”, _в связи с_
“in connection with”. The
component words are then still tagged according to their basic use
(_по_ is `ADP`, _сравнению_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as
multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation

### Examples

- _в;_ “in, at”
- _к_ “to”
- _на_ “on, at”
