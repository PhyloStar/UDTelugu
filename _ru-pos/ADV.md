### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such
categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify
[adjectives](ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _<b>очень</b> важно&nbsp;_ “very significantly” or
_<b>вероятно</b> неправильно&nbsp;_ “provably wrong”.

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to
circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly
to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative,
demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV`
part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

Note that Russian transgressives (also called adverbial participles)
are tagged [VERB](), not `ADV`.
