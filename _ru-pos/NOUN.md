### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing,
animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for
proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Russian nouns have the lexical feature [ru-feat/Gender]().
Furthermore, the nouns inflect for [ru-feat/Number]() and [ru-feat/Case]().

A verbal noun can be derived productively from almost every verb
(e.g. _есть_&nbsp; “to eat” → _поедание_&nbsp; “eating”).
While in other languages a corresponding form may be called gerund and tagged [VERB](),
in Russian it is tagged `NOUN`. It has always the neuter gender and the full
number-case inflectional paradigm.

### Examples
