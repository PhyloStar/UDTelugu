The _flat_ relation is one of three relations ([compound](), [fixed](), _flat_) 
used for special kinds of multiword expressions. It is used for expressions that
are semi-flexible (as opposed to _fixed_) and do not have a clear head (as opposed to
most cases of _compound_). The structure of the annotation attaches all non-first elements
to the first, but this should not be interpreted as an indication of headedness. 

A special case of _flat_ is constituted by complex names like _Olof Palme_ and 
_Carl XVI Gustaf_, which are annotated with the subtype _flat:name_.
