`nsubj` marks noun phrases that are the subject of a finite clause. In non-copular constructions, the head of an `nsubj` relation is typically a verb. Subjects need not necessarily be in the nominative case: other cases are often used to mark subjects, such as the ergative with the perfective aspect, or the dative for certain constructions.
