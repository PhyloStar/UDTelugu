### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. It should be used very restrictively. 

A special usage of `X` is for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is typically used in the syntactic analysis). This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal part-of-speech.

### Example

- 他突然說：「<b>lkjwe ashwi oiucs</b>」 / _tā túrán shuō：「lkjwe ashwi oiucs」_ "He suddenly said, 'lkjwe ashwi oiucs'."
