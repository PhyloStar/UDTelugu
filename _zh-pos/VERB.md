### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.

Despite its use in copular constructions, 是 / _shì_ "be" is tagged as a verb due to its other non-copular meanings and functions.

### Examples

- 游泳 / _yóuyǒng_ "swim"
- 聽 / _tīng_ "listen"
- 呼吸 / _hūxī_ "breathe"
- 喜歡 / _xǐhuān_ "like"
- 決定 / _juédìng_ "decide"
- 有 / _yǒu_ "have; own; exist"
- 是 / _shì_ "be; exist"
