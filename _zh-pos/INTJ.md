### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction, is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the language.

Note that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retain their original category when used in exclamations. For example, 是！ / _shì_ "Yes!" would still be tagged VERB.

Onomatopoeic words (擬聲詞 / _nǐshēngcí_) should only be treated as interjections if they are used as an exclamation (e.g., 喵! / _miāo_ "Meow!"), otherwise they should be tagged according to their syntactic function in context (often as adverbs in Chinese, e.g., 他們**嘰嘰喳喳**地聊天 / _tāmen jījizhāzhā de liáotiān_ "They chat _jijizhazha-ly_ (i.e., lively, noisily, etc.).").

### Examples
