### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a subordinate clause.

Subordinating conjunctions in Chinese include all markers of subordinate clauses, including conditional clauses, purpose clauses, etc.

In paired clauses where both clauses are marked by a conjunctive word and the first is subordinate to the second, we treat the conjunctive word in the first clause as `SCONJ`, whereas the one in the second, main clause as an adverb (<a>`ADV`</a>) (e.g., 雖然/SCONJ... 可是/ADV... / _suīrán... kěshì..._ "Although... however...").

### Examples

- 如果 / _rúguǒ_ "if", 的話 / _dehuà_ "if"
- 雖然 / _suīrán_ "although"
- 儘管 / _jǐnguǎn_ "even if"
- 無論 / _wúlùn_ "no matter"
- "in order to": 來 / _lái_, 去 / _qù_, 以 / _yǐ_
  - 伸出你的手<b>來</b>看看 / _shēn chū nǐ de shǒu <b>lái</b> kànkan_ "stretch out your hand (in order) to take a look"
