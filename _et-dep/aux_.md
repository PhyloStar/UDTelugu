An auxiliary of a clause is a non-main verb of the clause, e.g., a modal auxiliary, or an auxiliary in a periphrastic tense.
'olema' and in rare occasions 'saama' are auxiliaries that form periphrastic tense forms. In the current version of Estonain UD, only 'saama', 'võima', 'pidama', 'näima', 'paistma', 'tunduma' are regarded as modal auxiliaries.
