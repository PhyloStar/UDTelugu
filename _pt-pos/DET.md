### Definition
Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc.

In Portuguese corpora, numerals are not tagged as `DET`. In a noun phrase such as "os cinco mortos" (the five dead [people]), only "os" is tagged as `DET`.

### Examples

- articles (a closed class indicating definiteness, specificity or givenness): _o, a, os, as_
- possessive determiners: _meu, teu, seu, minha, meus, dele, nosso_
- demonstrative determiners: _este, isto, esta, aquele,_
- interrogative determiners: _qual_
- relative determiners: _que_
- quantity/quantifier determiners: _nenhum_, _todos_.
