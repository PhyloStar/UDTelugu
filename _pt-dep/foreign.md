We use `foreign` to label sequences of foreign words. These are given
a linear analysis: the head is the first token in the foreign phrase.

`foreign` does not apply to loanwords or to foreign [names](flat). 
It applies to quoted foreign text incorporated in a sentence/discourse
of the host language (unless we want to and know how to annotate the
internal structure according to the syntax of the foreign language).
