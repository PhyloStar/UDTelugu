The *vocative* relation is used to mark a dialogue participant
addressed in a text (common in conversations, dialogue, emails,
newsgroup postings, etc.).  The relation links the addressee's name to
its host sentence. A vocative commonly co-occurs with a null subject,
as in the first example below.  If the nominal is clearly vocative in
intent, the preference is to use the vocative relation.
