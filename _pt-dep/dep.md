A dependency is labeled as `dep` when a system is unable to
determine a more precise dependency relation between two words.  This
may be because of a weird grammatical construction, a limitation in
software (e.g. the Stanford Dependency conversion), a parser error, or
because of an unresolved long distance dependency.

In this example `dep` is used due the ambiguity of _sinalizado_  between adjective and verb participle.
