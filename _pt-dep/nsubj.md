A nominal subject (`nsubj`) is a nominal which is the syntactic subject and the proto-agent of a clause.
That is, it is in the position that passes typical grammatical test for subjecthood, and this argument is the more agentive,
the do-er, or the proto-agent of the clause. 
(See [csubj]() for when the subject is clausal. See [nsubjpass]() and [csubjpass]() for when the subject is not 
the proto-agent argument due to valence changing operations.) This nominal may be headed by a noun, 
or it may be a pronoun or relative pronoun, or in ellipsis contexts, other things such as an adjective.

<<!- The `nsubj` role is only applied to semantic arguments of a predicate.
When there is an empty argument in a grammatical subject position (sometimes called a pleonastic or expletive),
it is labeled as [expl](). If there is then a displaced subject
in the clause, as in the English existential _there_ construction, it will be labeled as `nsubj`.) -->

The governor of the `nsubj` relation might not always be a verb: when
the verb is a copular verb, the root of the clause is the complement
of the copular verb, which can be an adjective or noun, including a noun marked by a preposition,
as in the examples below.

Note that when the subject appears after the verb, it is still tagged as `nsubj`.

Note that complex subjects are treated as conjunctions and only the first element of the conjunction holds the `nsubj` relation.
