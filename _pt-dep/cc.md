For more on coordination, see the [conj]() relation.
A `cc` is the relation between the first conjunct and
the [coordinating conjunction](../pos/CCONJ) delimiting another conjunct.
(Note: different dependency grammars have different treatments of coordination.
We take the first conjunct as the head of the coordination.)

~~~ sdparse

A coordinating conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a
sentence. This is also called a `cc`, and it depends on the root
predicate of the sentence.


~~~ sdparse
E chegou lá.
cc(chegou, E)
~~~

Note that when many elements are coordinated, the `conj` relation holds between the connective and the first element of the conjunction.

~~~ sdparse

conj(pobre, limpo)
conj(pobre, acolhedor)
