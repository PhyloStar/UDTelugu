### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category. It should be used very restrictively.

A special usage of `X` is for cases of code-switching where it is not
possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language
grammatically (and where the dependency relation [flat:foreign](flat) is
typically used in the syntactic analysis).  This usage does not extend
to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal
part-of-speech. For example, in _he put on a large sombrero_,
_sombrero_ is an ordinary [NOUN]().

### Examples

- _And then he just <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>_
